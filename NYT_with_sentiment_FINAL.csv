127,45941,Ronen Bergman,The New York Times,"A Memo in a Bunker, Intercepted Communications and Hamas’s Oct. 7 Plans","A directive, which Israeli officials believe was written by Yahya Sinwar, the powerful leader of Hamas in Gaza, and recordings called for fighters to target soldiers and civilian communities — and to broadcast the violent acts. After assassinating a top Hamas commander, Muhammed Sinwar, in May 2025, the Israeli military sent a special unit into an underground complex he had used. There, they found a computer unconnected to a network — and much harder to access by Israeli operations spying on Hamas communications. The computer held an image of a six-page memo, handwritten in Arabic, that the Israeli intelligence community believes was by his brother Yahya Sinwar, who as the powerful leader of Hamas in Gaza helped plot the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Dated Aug. 24, 2022, it appears to be a directive from Mr. Sinwar with instructions for the assault, according to seven Israeli officials. The memo, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, calls for fighters to target soldiers and civilian communities — as well as to broadcast the violent acts so as to evoke fear in Israelis and destabilize the country. Commanders then issued similar instructions on Oct. 7, according to hours of previously unreported communications between commanders and subordinates intercepted by Israel during the assault and shared with The Times. The Israeli officials say the memo shows that Mr. Sinwar wanted his fighters to target civilians from the outset, contradicting what the group’s leadership has publicly claimed. Although the memo does not explicitly mention plans to kidnap or kill civilians, it lays out orders for fighters to enter residential neighborhoods and set them on fire “with gasoline or diesel from a tanker.” “Two or three operations, in which an entire neighborhood, kibbutz, or something similar will be burned, must be prepared,” the memo said. In an echo to the memo, just before 10 a.m. on Oct. 7, a commander from a Gaza City battalion referred to as Abu Muhammed told subordinates: “Start setting homes on fire.” “Burn, burn,” he said, according to the intercepts. “I want the whole kibbutz to be in flames.” “Set fire to anything,” a commander in the northern Gaza city of Jabaliya referred to as Abu al-Abed said around the same time. The memo and the intercepts broaden the understanding of Hamas’s planning and execution of the Oct. 7 attack, much of which is based on other documents and recordings collected by Israel during the war. Israel and Hamas have now agreed to a cease-fire, with the militant group’s future in Gaza uncertain. Sima Ankona, who formerly served as a document examination expert in the Israeli police, said the handwriting in the memo matches other examples from Yahya Sinwar, who was killed by Israeli forces in October 2024. Ms. Ankona, at the request of The Times, compared the document with samples that Israeli authorities had collected, including those captured by the military in Gaza, a note Mr. Sinwar wrote to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 2018, and his signature on a statement to the Israeli police in 1989. (He was convicted later that year of killing four Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel.) The Times translated the memo. Several words and phrases in it appear in other Hamas documents previously reviewed by The Times. Izzat al-Rishq, the Qatar-based director of Hamas’s media office, did not respond to a list of detailed questions, including whether Hamas’s leadership outside Gaza was aware of the memo and the orders that commanders gave militants on Oct. 7. Ibrahim Madhoun, a Palestinian analyst close to Hamas, cast doubt on the authenticity of the memo, asserting that most of the acts described in the document did not occur in the Oct. 7 assault, such as the burning of entire neighborhoods. (Many homes were set on fire in the course of the attacks.) He added that the memo did not represent the culture of Hamas’s military wing. The intercepts were collected on the day of the attack by 8200, the Israeli military’s signals intelligence unit, according to three Israeli security officials, who shared them with The Times. The Times reviewed and translated hours of the intercepted recordings, which included communications in Arabic among commanders and eight groups of fighters. The memo and the intercepts, said several Israeli officials, have been studied by Israel to deepen their understanding of Hamas’s attack. The Gazit Institute, a think tank affiliated with the Israeli military intelligence directorate, prepared a confidential report on the materials, saying that the “Hamas leadership planned and carried out an attack that featured acts of ‘extraordinary brutality.’” “Its aim was to cause great turmoil in the country and the military,” said the report, which was reviewed by The Times. The security lapses revealed in the Oct. 7 attack, including Israel’s failure to find such documents ahead of time and its disregard of other warnings, have prompted a broad examination by the Israeli intelligence community. The attack, the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust, shattered Israelis’ sense of security. The Israeli officials all spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. During the Oct. 7 attack, Hamas and its allies killed some 1,200 people and abducted about 250 others to Gaza. Israel, in response, unleashed its full military might in a war that has killed tens of thousands of people in Gaza, displaced most of its residents, and reduced cities to rubble. Israel has been condemned internationally for its conduct in the war and faced accusations of war crimes from human rights groups. It has been accused by a United Nations commission of committing genocide, which the Israeli government has denied. In May 2024, Karim Khan, the International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor, accused Yahya Sinwar and two other senior Hamas officials of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including “extermination” and “murder.” The crimes were committed as a part of “a widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population of Israel by Hamas and other armed groups,” Mr. Khan said when he announced the charges. Under international law, armies and armed groups must not deliberately target civilians or inflict disproportionate harm on them to achieve military goals. In particular, killing and taking as hostages those who are uninvolved in hostilities are serious violations of the Geneva Conventions. The handwritten memo and intercepts offer a more granular look at the group’s thinking and its actions in real time. The memo outlined a plan for a surprise attack on Israel, calling for bulldozers to make openings in the fence separating Gaza and Israel, and multiple waves of attackers. It expressed hope that the acts would have high shock value. “Stomp on the heads of soldiers,” it said. It listed “opening fire on soldiers at point-blank range, slaughtering some of them with knives, blowing up tanks.” Commanders echoed similar instructions on the day of the attack, according to the intercepts. “Slit their throats,” a commander from a battalion in northern Gaza told his team. “Slit them as you are trained.” Roughly 300 soldiers were killed in the Oct. 7 attack, according to Israeli authorities. The intercepts captured Hamas combatants broadly calling for violence and taking captives. When a militant asked if he should confront people on the road, a commander from a Jabaliya battalion referred to as Abu Muath responded in the affirmative: “Kill everyone on the road,” he said. “Kill everyone you encounter.” “Now we are at the beginning of the kibbutz,” said one combatant. “We have wiped out those in it. There are settlers whom we killed.” “Guys, take a lot of hostages,” said the commander, Abu Muath, according to the intercepts. “Take a lot of hostages.” The group’s actions, the memo said, should be broadcast to the Arab world to mobilize people outside Gaza to join the fight. The plan envisioned that Palestinians in the West Bank, Arabs in Israel and “our nation” — either a reference to Arabs or Muslims or both — would “respond positively to calls for them to join the revolution.” “It needs to be affirmed to the unit commanders to undertake these actions intentionally, film them and broadcast images of them as fast as possible,” the memo said. The minutes of Hamas’s secret meetings in the run-up to the Oct. 7 attack also show how Mr. Sinwar was determined to persuade Hamas’s allies, Iran and Hezbollah, to join in the assault, or commit to a broader fight with Israel. In the Oct. 7 intercepts, Hamas commanders can be heard urging combatants to film their actions to likewise encourage others to join the fight. “Document the scenes of horror, now, and broadcast them on TV channels to the whole world,” a commander from Gaza City called Abu al-Baraa told operatives in the area of Kibbutz Sa’ad. “Slaughter them. End the children of Israel.” Abu Muath, the commander, said, “It is essential that you bring the drone in so it films for the entire Islamic world.” Hamas officials also made public statements on the day of the attack, encouraging people outside Gaza to participate in the battle, though they ultimately failed to incite a popular uprising. The Israeli military “won’t be able to attend to confrontations on other fronts,” Saleh al-Arouri, the deputy leader of Hamas’s political office said in a recorded message broadcast on Al Jazeera on Oct 7. “After today, no one can hold back his rifle, bullet, pistol, knife, car, or Molotov cocktail.” Israel assassinated Mr. al-Arouri in January 2024.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12,1575,0.434,0.203,0.129,0.491,0.5,0.246,0.42,0.149,0.287,0.5,0.5

131,45939,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,"Give Trump the Nobel for Gaza, if He Does the Harder Parts to Come","I hope that if the first stage of this Gaza cease-fire, hostage release and prisoner exchange comes off as planned in the next few days that President Trump is showered with praise — for three reasons that could impact the future of both the Middle East and America. First, because getting to this point really was hard. It took a geopolitical bank shot that had to bounce off — and simultaneously win the trust of — Israel, Hamas, Qatar, Turkey, the Palestinian Authority, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the U.A.E. before landing in Gaza. On the degree-of-difficulty scale, this was right up there. Good for the president and his team for engineering it. Second, this is just the first stage of a multistage plan. So if Trump owns this early part, has his name on it and wins accolades for bringing it off, it should ensure that he remains engaged to push through the later stages of his peace plan. They are much harder and — I cannot stress this enough — they will require Trump staying fully engaged. Mr. President, you may not be interested in Palestinian or Jewish history, but they are now both very interested in you. I worry that Trump does not fully respect the complexity of the task his administration has taken on with the plan that will bear his name. We are talking about full-scale nation-building in Gaza, which is almost completely destroyed, yet still home to some two million uprooted people. With a national security team that is now woefully small, Trump will have to oversee the disarmament of Hamas, the recruitment and development of a multinational security force to fill the vacuum created when Israel withdraws, the rebuilding of Gaza from scratch and the forging of a transitional government to run the place. And it will all be done under the eye of an Israeli government that is deeply suspicious that Hamas will regroup. Trump told his cabinet Thursday with his usual penchant for exaggeration: “We ended the war in Gaza, and on a much bigger basis, created peace … hopefully an everlasting peace in the Middle East.” I sure hope he does not really believe that, because he will be working on Gaza for the rest of his presidency. That said, if successful, the implementation of the harder stages holds the promise of reviving, over time, the possibility of a two-state solution under a totally new formula — one that combines Palestinian, Arab and international stewardship over Gaza’s future. If it works, the arrangement might one day be extended to the West Bank. I think Trump’s team has come up with an intriguing new model for dealing with the future of both occupied territories, because Israelis and Palestinians can no longer resolve their conflict alone. After the Gaza war, there is not a shred of trust left between them. The gears for collaboration are all stripped bare. They will need permanent U.S. and Arab guarantors for peace. (More on this another day.) If the implementation of all the stages of this peace plan rebuilds a pathway for Israeli-Palestinian peace, that would be worthy of a Nobel Peace Prize. Maybe even two. The third reason I hope Trump gets his due for engineering this peace plan has nothing to do with the Middle East. It’s out of a hope, which is probably in vain, that this might actually inspire Trump to make peace in America as well. “Blessed are the peacemakers,” Trump wrote on social media. Well, they sure are, Mr. President, and now that you have brought a measure of peace to Gaza by showing respect and building trust with all the parties — you even got a longtime U.S. enemy, Hamas, to trust you — please try the same diplomacy at home. Instead of making America as fractured as Gaza, by indicting your political foes on the flimsiest of charges and boasting that “I hate my opponent,” as you did at the Charlie Kirk memorial, why not surprise us all on the upside: Invite the Democratic leaders to Camp David and tell the world you’re not coming out without an American-American peace treaty? Remember, you won. You’re president. Set a positive example and rise above all your personal grievances. Look at all the good you can do in the world by forging compromises. Do that at home and your popularity will soar. Don’t do that — and keep playing the uniter in the Middle East and the divider in America — and this Gaza plan will be a footnote to a failed presidency. To that end, I hope Trump reflects on how he pulled together the Mideast deal. His is a rather unusual diplomatic negotiating style. When it came to seeking peace in Gaza, Trump was not interested in the politics of distributing blame or slinging humiliating nicknames at any of the parties, including Israel, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. He was only interested in getting to yes with those who could make it happen and get him closer to a Nobel Peace Prize. In a region where few leaders do not have blood on their hands or political prisoners in jail (for advocating human rights), Trump is a welcome relief from Democratic presidents. He doesn’t give two cents about the human rights scorecard of any of these players. But he also was not ready to indulge their usual excuses about how their domestic politics would not allow them to compromise. Trump’s approach was: I am not interested in who you are; I will judge you by what you do. If it is what I want and need, you are great; if it gets in my way, I will make you pay. Democrats, generally speaking, are just not as good at combining moral indifference with coercive diplomacy in the name of peace. It comes naturally to Trump. Middle Eastern leaders see him as one of them. As Secretary of State Marco Rubio put it: “The president had some extraordinary phone calls and meetings that required a high degree of intensity and commitment and made this happen.” Oh, boy, as a Middle East aficionado, I would love to have listened in on those calls! Both Hamas and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel will find a way to say this result is a great achievement, but it is not the result they were seeking as they fought this war. Hamas launched this war on Oct. 7, 2023, in part to destroy a Biden plan that started with reforming the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank — Hamas’s archrival, which has embraced the Oslo peace accords. This reform of the P.A., in the Biden plan, was then supposed to pave the way for negotiations with Israel on a two-state solution and, in return for that, Saudi Arabia was to normalize relations with Israel, and the U.S. and Saudi Arabia were to sign a security treaty. Hamas, and its regional backer, Iran, did not want to see any Palestinian progress toward a two-state agreement that would be led by the P.A., let alone normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia. That would have left both Iran and Hamas very isolated. Now they are both isolated and militarily devastated. At the same time, Netanyahu fought this war — from Day 1, in my view — in a way that he hoped would result in Israel’s controlling Gaza forever, through some kind of quisling local forces that would not include either Hamas — the terrorists who started the war — or the Palestinian Authority — the logical alternative to Hamas. Bibi constantly sought to delegitimize the P.A. because he did not want a single moderate Palestinian negotiating body that could represent the Palestinians in both the West Bank and Gaza. That would immediately have led to global pressure to negotiate a two-state solution. With Trump Bibi got just the opposite. Trump’s plan doesn’t promise Palestinian statehood, but it stipulates that as Gaza redevelopment advances and the Palestinian Authority reform program is carried out, “the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognize as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.” Netanyahu played into Trump’s hands by putting himself entirely in Trump’s hands. Over the last year, in pursuing his scorched-earth policy in Gaza, Bibi told the world to get lost, Europe to get lost, Democrats to get lost, liberal American Jews to get lost, Israel’s Arab allies to get lost, even moderate Republicans to get lost. He put Israel’s fate entirely in Trump’s hands, thinking that when Trump came up with his first Gaza plan — a cockamamie plan to get all the Palestinians out of Gaza and turn it into a new Riviera — Trump had given him a free pass to raze Gaza. But when the Arabs and America’s European allies, and Tony Blair, weighed in and turned Trump back toward a real peace process — declaring that Israel could not annex Gaza or the West Bank — Netanyahu had no lever left to pull. He had no Trump or Republicans to undermine the president the way he did with Joe Biden. That is what got us here, and why is “here” so important? A member of the Israeli negotiating team at Camp David in 2000, Gidi Grinstein, put it well in an email to me: The 20-point Trump plan offers a pivotal opportunity to not only bring peace to Gaza and free the hostages, but to “re-establish the longstanding fundamental principles of the Israeli-Arab and Israeli-Palestinian diplomatic process since the Camp David Accords of 1978-79.” How so? Trump has established, Grinstein explained, “that there will be no unilateral annexations in Gaza or the West Bank; that an upgraded and reformed Palestinian Authority will be the self-governing body of the Palestinians in the West Bank and, in the future, in Gaza.” And the political horizon, he went on, includes a nod by Trump toward the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, which, Grinstein wrote, “effectively means some form of political separation between Israel and the Palestinians.” As I said, just stopping this terrible Gaza war — if it holds — is worthy of praise and the stuff of wonderful headlines. But seeing this whole plan through would be the stuff of history and Nobel Prizes. And getting Trump to realize what made him effective in the Middle East — governing by addition, not division — would actually make him so much better a president at home. That would be the stuff of miracles.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,14,1759,0.572,0.873,0.615,0.341,0.114,0.369,0.376,0.614,0.74,0.5,0.796
132,45938,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,The Only Way To Solve the Israel-Hamas War,"On this second anniversary of the war, how am I feeling? This has been the longest Israeli-Palestinian war. It’s also been the first war that, despite its length — two years now — it actually has no name. The 1948 War, the War of Independence, the Nakba War from the Palestinian point of view, the ’67 War, the Six-Day War, the Sinai War, the October War. This war, two years later, still has no name. I have a name for it. It’s the Worst War. This is absolutely the worst war ever between Israelis and Palestinians. It comes after a failed attempted peace. It’s a war that was launched by Hamas with complete viciousness aimed to kill as many Israeli soldiers and civilians as Hamas soldiers could encounter. And it triggered an Israeli response against Hamas that has devastated Gaza, inflicted tens of thousands of Palestinian casualties — both soldiers and civilians — and has done so without Israel offering any political horizon for the morning after. It’s left both communities more devastated physically, more traumatized than ever, and farther than ever from what is the only solution: two states for two people. So now, thanks to an initiative by President Trump, the two sides, Hamas and Israel, are trying to forge a cease-fire that will involve a return of all the Israeli hostages, both living and dead; the release of Palestinian prisoners, hundreds of them in Israeli jails; and an Israeli withdrawal from at least most of Gaza to some border region. Basically, paving the way for an international peacekeeping force to come into Gaza and secure the areas where Israel is evacuated. And a Palestinian technocratic cabinet to basically run Gaza. And over and above that cabinet, a kind of international body chaired by President Trump to supervise the reconstruction of Gaza. It’s an extremely complicated plan in an extremely broken place. There have been a lot of optimistic noises about whether or not this will be achieved. I certainly pray that it will be, but I think it’s going to be very difficult. Hamas is going to want to retain at least some arms for its people for self-protection so it can still play a political role in a postwar Gaza. And Israel is going to be very careful about how far and wide it withdraws from Gaza and what kind of security arrangement will fill in its wake. I hope this cease-fire that President Trump has initiated will come to fruition. I’m watching every day, but it’s not going to be easy. What intrigues me about this plan is that it contains the seeds of what I think is the only possible solution now to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Former U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is sometimes credited with saying, when you have a difficult problem, enlarge it. And in effect, that’s what we’re doing. I think the thing that people need to understand most about the peace talks going on right now is the sheer number of actors involved. The underlying logic of this plan is that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is now so broken, the two sides are so traumatized, that this problem can no longer be solved with the traditional tools and at the traditional level that it was resolved before: the two sides negotiating with each other and an international mediator in between them. I believe if we are ever going to get to two states for two people, it’s actually going to require some kind of international body to oversee both Gaza and the West Bank to assure Israelis that no threat can ever come from those areas, that they don’t have to rely on Palestinian promises to demilitarize. And to assure Palestinians that Israelis will be gone and enable Palestinians to develop their own noncorrupt governing authority. Basically, if we want to solve this problem now, I think we have to go back to a kind of agreed-upon Arab international mandate to oversee the reconstruction of Gaza and to oversee the rebuilding of Palestinian governance in the West Bank. Only that kind of international structure that would assure both decent Palestinian governance and real demilitarization of both Gaza and the West Bank, supervised by international troops that would almost surely have to have an American component — I think that’s the only way to solve this problem now. Let’s step back for a second and ask: How did we get to this point where we can even have these kinds of talks that are going on in Egypt this week? It’s for several reasons. One is that Iran and its threat network — Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, the Shia militias in Iraq — Iran was dealt a devastating blow by Israel with the help of the United States in what was called the 12-Day War. So Iran’s ability to meddle and destroy peace talks has been severely set back. Israel under Prime Minister Netanyahu finds itself not only more isolated than ever internationally, but it also has a very different diplomatic and political problem with the Trump administration. Whenever U.S. presidents, particularly Democrats, tried to press Prime Minister Netanyahu to enter into peace negotiations, Netanyahu could always run to evangelical Christians, to Republicans, basically, and use them as a lever to neutralize the White House and to deflate any pressure on Israel. But under Trump, that’s not possible because he completely controls his party now. And so Netanyahu found himself forced to enter into these negotiations very grudgingly. But his old levers that he used to pull in order to diffuse American pressure, they weren’t available under Trump. For Palestinians, you have an analogous situation. For decades, basically, Palestinians were able to have enormous influence over the core of Arab leadership in Egypt, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq by threatening them. If they didn’t support the Palestinian cause, which their people did, the Palestinian movement would attack and delegitimize those leaders. And because those leaders in most cases were illegitimate, they were very vulnerable to that sort of political blackmail from Palestinians. But what’s happened in the last 10, 15 years is that leadership of the Arab world has moved from republics like Egypt, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq to the gulf. To Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. in particular. And these monarchies have a lot more legitimacy, and therefore they’re actually not so vulnerable to the traditional Palestinian blandishments. And they have made it very clear that they’re ready to participate in a cease-fire in Gaza and in a new transition for a different kind of Palestinian governance. One thing we know about the Palestinians living in Gaza — many of whom have been uprooted four, five, six times from their homes — is that they’re exhausted. They’re traumatized. They’ve lost their homes in many, many cases and have lost family and relatives. They want this over. And I think that’s another pressure on Hamas. Hamas knows that it does not have the Mandate of Heaven anymore to perpetuate this war indefinitely. So for all these reasons, the parties have found it very difficult to avoid this negotiation. This is a hugely complicated process. Certainly, one of the key actors has been the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu was finally cornered by Trump and forced to accept this deal. Let’s remember last January, December, President Biden had a very similar deal on the table and Netanyahu rejected it. He walked away from it after the first stage of hostage release.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,8,1249,0.38,0.105,0.373,0.146,0.5,0.181,0.215,0.18,0.223,0.5,0.432
133,45929,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,Can the Trump Peace Plan Overcome Unprecedented Cruelty?,"President Trump’s 20-point peace plan for Gaza is a smart plan for turning a bomb crater into a launchpad for peace — for taking a terrible, terrible war in Gaza and leveraging it to not only create a new foundation for solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but also for normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Syria and maybe even Iraq as well. If it succeeds, it could even set in motion a much-needed transformation in Iran. Hats off to its key architects: Jared Kushner, Steve Witkoff and Tony Blair. Without their efforts, this initiative would not have been born. But while it may be unprecedented in its creativity, it meets a moment unprecedented in its cruelty, which makes it a long shot at best. If only this plan were meant to solve a border dispute between Swedes and Norwegians. Alas, it is meant to halt the most vicious and deadly two years of fighting between Jews and Palestinians in the history of this conflict. The indiscriminate murder on Oct. 7, 2023, by Hamas of Israelis in front of their children and children in front of their parents, on top of the kidnapping of babies and elderly people, which was met by the often indiscriminate retaliation by an Israeli army that was daily prepared to kill and maim dozens of Palestinian civilians and children to get one Hamas fighter — while grinding Gaza into rubble — may have done something no previous Israeli-Arab war ever did: It made the necessary — achieving peace — impossible. In a lifetime of covering this conflict, I have never seen it broken into so many little pieces, each soaked in more distrust and hatred of the other than ever before. Aggregating these pieces together to implement this complex plan for a cease-fire, phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, hostage release, Palestinian prisoner release and then rebuilding of the Strip under international supervision will be a herculean task. It will require solving a diplomatic Rubik’s Cube every day — while all the enemies of the deal try to scramble it every day. I doubt Trump appreciates just how herculean an effort it will be, how much time and political capital it will require from him personally and how much he will have to squeeze both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Hamas and America’s Arab allies to do things that they not only won’t want to do, but that could be dangerous for them to do both politically and physically. While Netanyahu said he agreed to this plan, I will believe it when I hear him saying it in Hebrew to his own people and cabinet. Friedman’s first rule of Middle East reporting: What people tell you in private is irrelevant. All that matters is what they say in public to their own people in their own language. In Washington, officials lie in public and tell the truth in private. In the Middle East, officials lie in private and tell the truth in public. And Hamas, whose surviving leadership is mostly hiding in a bunker in Doha, still has to sign on. “There are so many ways that Netanyahu or Hamas can sabotage this,” Nahum Barnea, the Yedioth Ahronoth columnist, told me — but, like me, he thinks it’s worth a try and commends those who drew up the plan Because it is so necessary in so many ways. For starters, anyone with the most rudimentary knowledge of warfare and where it is going can see that Israelis and Arabs and Iranians cannot afford for there to be another war. Smarter and cheaper drones and even missiles are being distributed ever farther, super-empowering more actors faster. I don’t need to remind Israelis that on June 1 more than 100 Ukrainian drones that had been smuggled into Russia struck air bases deep inside Russia, damaging or destroying at least a dozen warplanes, including long-range strategic bombers. I am guessing that this daring surprise attack cost Ukraine something closer to a big shopping spree at Best Buy than anything approaching the roughly $80 million price of a single Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jet in Israel’s fleet. Second, Netanyahu can say all that he wants, as he did on Monday, that if Hamas does not accept this plan, “Israel will finish the job by itself” in Gaza, which Trump said he’d support. Easier said than done. If that happens, Israel will have a permanent military occupation of Gaza facing a permanent insurgency — which its own military leadership opposes. Some “finish.” That is why now that Trump has put this deal on the table, it will not be easy for Bibi or Hamas to definitively reject it. That leads to the final reason this deal is necessary even if it seems impossible. The proliferation of social media, particularly TikTok, means that video of every single civilian casualty — every dismembered civilian — can now be broadcast to the smartphone of everyone on the planet. So, as Israel is discovering, the only way it can defeat an enemy like Hamas, embedded among civilians, is at the price of making itself a pariah among nations and having its sports teams, academics and entertainers shunned around the world. Netanyahu can declare, with some real justification, that Israel is defending Western democratic values by defeating the Islamo-fascist Hamas in Gaza. Hamas is a terrible organization — most of all for Palestinians. But today any teenager on TikTok can also see how, at the same time, Bibi and Israel’s Jewish supremacists are perpetuating Western-style settler colonialism in the West Bank. No one is fooled — and I mean no one. A “Pew poll, carried out in March 2025, found a significant shift in younger Republicans’ views of Israel since 2022, with views of Republicans under 50 years old becoming far more negative of Israel (50 percent) compared to 35 percent in 2022 — a 15-point shift,” according to the University of Maryland professor Shibley Telhami, who analyzed this and other survey data. This peace plan is also necessary because we must not give up on a two-state solution — no matter how unlikely, because it remains the only just and rational outcome for this conflict. But we have to recognize that we cannot get there from here. We need a bridge that builds trust where every shred of trust has been destroyed. This plan proposes to do so by effectively creating a U.N.-approved mandate for putting Gaza under the supervision of an international governing body and military force with Arab approval and input from the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. The logic is that until and unless Palestinians in Gaza can build and demonstrate the capacity to govern there, it is impossible to talk about a two-state solution. But to give Palestinians the best chance to demonstrate that, they need not only international support, but also for Israel to get out of the way in Gaza, and, I would add, halt all Israeli settlement-building in the West Bank, which has been designed to erase any possibility of Palestinian sovereignty there one day. Israel must be made to leave open the possibility of Palestinian statehood if the Palestinians achieve certain governance metrics. Only Trump — whose plan acknowledges statehood “as the aspiration of the Palestinian people” — can force that upon Bibi. But here is the hidden incentive for Israel to seize on this Trump plan. Israel’s devastating destruction of both Iran and Hezbollah’s military capacity was a tactical military victory that has opened up enormous new possibilities for regional integration. It led to the toppling of Iran’s puppet regime in Syria and paved the way for a fragile democratic coalition to take power there. It created the space for Lebanon’s best leadership duo since the civil war — President Joseph Aoun and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam — to free Lebanon’s frail democracy from the death grip of Iran and Hezbollah. It has also opened more space for the democratically elected government of Iraq to gain better control of the pro-Iranian militias there. At the same time, it has triggered a quiet debate inside Iran about the whole efficacy of spending billions of dollars, and making Tehran an international pariah, to support losers like Hamas and Hezbollah and permanently threaten Israel. If, if, if this Trump peace plan can create a bridge back to a two-state solution, it will give enormous leeway for Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Syria and even Iraq to consider joining the Abraham Accords and normalize relations with Israel. In other words, it would turn the tactical military defeat Israel and the Trump administration inflicted on Iran in the 12-day war into a strategic achievement. Trump actually went out of his way in his White House news conference on Monday to signal to Iran that he is open to a new relationship, if Tehran is. “Who knows, maybe even Iran can get in there,” Trump said, speaking of the Abraham Accords, with Netanyahu standing close by. Raghida Dergham, executive chairwoman of the Beirut Institute, observed the other day in a smart essay published in Annahar Al-Arabi, that for this to happen, Israel must overcome its “siege mentality and militarized bravado” and Iran must overcome its “bazaar mentality, swinging between bluster and concession, escalation and retreat.” Iran’s leadership, she noted, keeps moving “one step toward compromise and two steps toward escalation, still clinging to the illusion that time favors them. But beneath their defiance lies quiet panic. In this cornered state, Tehran continues to make costly miscalculations, particularly around Israel and the dwindling myths of the so-called ‘Axis of Resistance,’ led by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen, and to a lesser extent in Syria, where Iran’s networks have been severed.” If this Trump deal goes ahead, it will so isolate Iran that maybe, finally, it will also trigger a real internal struggle and change of strategy there. My bottom line: If you are a betting person, bet that the necessary will be impossible — you have a lot of history on your side that says the closer we get to peace, the more the haters will derail it. If you are a hoping person, hope that this time will be different. If you are praying person, pray that everything you know about this region, its current leaders and the poisonous legacy of the Gaza war will be overcome — because somehow the key players all realize that this really is the last train to somewhere decent and the next one, and all those ever after, will be nonstops to the gates of hell.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,8,1764,0.127,0.755,0.177,0.248,0.212,0.099,0.547,0.636,0.561,0.5,0.551
134,45894,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,Israel’s Gaza Campaign Is Making It a Pariah State,"I will leave it to historians to debate whether Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. But what is absolutely clear to me right now is that this Israeli government is committing suicide, homicide and fratricide. It is destroying Israel’s standing in the world, it is killing Gazan civilians with seemingly no regard for innocent human life, and it is tearing apart Israeli society and world Jewry, between those Jews who want to still stand with Israel no matter what and those who can no longer tolerate, explain or justify where this Israeli government is taking the Jewish state and now want to distance themselves from it. I was struck by this paragraph in The Times’s story from Israel on Monday about the Israeli strikes on a hospital in southern Gaza, killing at least 20 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry — including five journalists who worked for international media outlets, plus medics and several others: “The Israeli military said it had carried out a strike in the area of Nasser Hospital, without saying what the target was. The statement said the military regretted ‘any harm to uninvolved individuals,’ adding that its chief of staff had ordered an immediate inquiry.” Obviously sensing that many around the world were appalled by this explanation — I mean, how many times have we heard this? — the office of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, issued a rare statement of contrition, saying that “Israel deeply regrets the tragic mishap.” The truth is, though, what Netanyahu called a “tragic mishap” is the inevitable byproduct of his policy of stringing out the war in Gaza in order to stay in power, to avoid his criminal trials and to avoid any Israeli inquiry commission into his profound complicity in the failure to prevent the surprise attack by Hamas on Oct. 7. For Netanyahu to stay in power, he needs the support of far-right ministers, like Bezalel Smotrich, who is engaged in an effort to carpet the West Bank with as many Jewish settlements as he can to prevent any Palestinian state from emerging there. Smotrich is also encouraging the eviction of Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza, to pave the way for Israel to absorb both. But here’s the problem: Israel has already devastated Hamas as a military force and killed virtually all of its top commanders who planned the Oct. 7 attack. So now, to justify the continued war effort, it must go after lower-level commanders, who are living and hiding among civilians. It is one thing for a country at war to justify collateral damage when going after the enemy’s top leaders. It is something entirely more sinister when you are killing and wounding dozens of civilians to try to kill, say, the deputy to the deputy commander. It is also devious and sinister when you use your military to move hundreds of thousands of Gazan civilians from one part of Gaza to the other — under the guise of evacuating them from fighting zones — and then deliberately bulldoze the homes they left behind for no real military reason but with the clear ulterior motive of making life so miserable for them that they will leave the area entirely. And it is shameful when you stop and start humanitarian aid, with the hope that people will get hungry enough to leave. But as I said, this is not just homicide pure and simple; it is also suicide and fratricide. Israel is now well on its way to making itself a pariah state — to the point that Israelis will think twice about speaking Hebrew when traveling abroad. Consider these recent news items from around the world: “The manager of a leisure park in southern France has been detained for alleged religious discrimination after a group of Israeli children were refused access.” “Australia has hit back at Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu after he branded the country’s prime minister ‘weak,’ with an Australian minister accusing the Israeli leader of conflating strength with killing people.” “When 1,600 Israelis aboard a Mano Maritime cruise were stranded off the Greek island of Syros … as protesters blocked their entry, it was a jarring reminder that Israeli tourists today can face hostility simply because of their passports.” Unfair, says the Israeli government. The world seems to have forgotten, it argues, that Hamas murdered some 1,200 people; kidnapped some 250, including women, children and elderly; and is still holding some alive in inhumane conditions in tunnels and elsewhere in Gaza. Hamas’s leadership could have ended all of this suffering by agreeing to quit Gaza and release all its hostages. By perpetuating this war, Hamas has also engaged in its own heinous crimes — the murder of Israeli hostages and the human sacrifice of thousands of Gazans to Hamas’s mad dreams. It’s all true — and relevant. So why is the world ganging up only on Israel now? Because it holds Israel to a higher standard than Hamas, because Israel has always held itself to a higher standard. And because the world can tell the difference now between a war being waged for the survival of the Jewish state and a war being waged for the political survival of its prime minister. And finally, because the world can no longer look the other way, as it did for months, at the loss of Palestinian civilian life in Gaza as the inevitable byproduct of a war in which — it hoped — Israel was trying to expel Hamas from Gaza and replace it with an Arab peacekeeping force in partnership with the Palestinian Authority. The P.A. has recognized Israel and could, if reformed, be a partner for a two-state solution. But because Netanyahu has now made it crystal clear that he refuses to let Gaza be ruled by either Hamas or the P.A., the war increasingly looks like what it now is: a war to extend Israel’s occupation from the West Bank to Gaza. So it appears to many around the world that Palestinian civilians are being killed by the dozen almost daily as the inevitable spillover not from a just war for Israeli survival and an attempt to produce a better Palestinian partner in Gaza but rather from an effort to ensure that Israel has no Palestinian partner in Gaza. Is it any wonder Israel is losing so many friends around the world — as well as potential regional partners like Saudi Arabia — for whom this is becoming obvious? As for fratricide, if this war continues this way, it is going to rip apart many, many synagogues around the world during the Jewish High Holy Days this year — between those who feel the need to stand with Israel, right or wrong, and those who simply can’t stand this Israeli government’s awful behavior in Gaza any longer, especially when they see hundreds of thousands of Israelis themselves taking to the streets against this government. It is also going to rip apart the Democratic Party, between those who are afraid to defy the influential American pro-Israel lobbying group AIPAC, for fear of losing campaign funding to their Republican opponents, and those who just can’t stand it any longer. Alas, if this is geopolitical suicide, as I believe, it has become assisted suicide. There is one person who could stop it all right now, and that is President Trump. I hope that I am wrong, but I fear that — just as Trump was duped by Vladimir Putin into giving up on a cease-fire in Ukraine and opting instead for the chimera of total peace — Trump has been duped by Netanyahu into giving up on a cease-fire in Gaza in pursuit of Bibi’s fantasy of “total victory.”",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,9,1286,0.062,0.096,0.089,0.197,0.16,0.165,0.123,0.14,0.24,0.5,0.276
135,45867,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,How Netanyahu Played Trump for a Fool in Gaza,"On July 26 the Israeli newspaper Haaretz ran this headline: “Israel at War Day 659. Gaza Medical Sources: At Least 25 Killed by Israeli Gunfire, Some While Waiting for Aid.” If you had been following this Gaza story closely, you would know that Haaretz was running a similar headline almost every day for weeks — only the number of Palestinians killed while waiting for food aid handed out by Israel in Gaza changed. As I watched these stories pile up, the thought occurred to me that roughly a month earlier Israel had managed to assassinate 10 senior Iranian military officials and 16 nuclear scientists sitting in their homes and offices. So how was it that Israel had the capacity to destroy pinpoint targets in Iran, some 1,200 miles from Tel Aviv, and could not safely deliver boxes of food to starving Gazans 40 miles from Tel Aviv? That did not seem like an accident. It seemed like the product of something deeper, something quite shameful, playing out within the extremist government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Key figures in Bibi’s extreme-right ruling coalition, like the national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, openly pushed a policy that would result in the starvation of many Gazans — to the point where they would leave the strip entirely. Bibi knew the United States wouldn’t let him go that far, so he provided just the bare minimum of aid to prevent being toppled by the Jewish supremacist thugs he’d brought into his government. Alas, that turned out to be a little too bare, and terrible pictures of malnourished children started emerging from Gaza, prompting even President Trump to declare on Monday that there is “real starvation stuff” happening in Gaza. “You can’t fake that. We have to get the kids fed.” How did we get here, where a Jewish democratic state, descended in part from the Holocaust, is engaged in a policy of starvation in a war with Hamas that has become the longest and most deadly war between Israelis and Palestinians in Israel’s history — and shows no sign of ending? My answer: What makes this war different is that it pits what I believe is the worst, most fanatical and amoral government in Israel’s history against the worst, most fanatical, murderous organization in Palestinian history. But they are alike not just in the awfulness of their goals — each seeking to wipe out the other to control all the territory from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea. They are also guided by leaders who have consistently prioritized their own political survival and ideological obsessions over the basic well-being of their own people — not to mention the interests of the United States. You may have noticed that this war has no generally accepted name — like the Six-Day War, the Sinai War or the October War. Well, I personally have always had a name for it. It’s the War of the Worst. This is the first Israeli-Palestinian war where the worst leaders on both sides are calling all the shots. The moderate Israeli opposition parties and the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank have no influence. And that is why I cannot tell you how or when it will end. Because Netanyahu still insists on “total victory” over Hamas, which he will never achieve, and the Hamas leadership still insists on surviving this war in order to still control Gaza the morning after, which it does not deserve. Let’s go to the videotape: For months Hamas has been fully aware of the acute food and housing shortage in Gaza — shortages it helped trigger by launching a savage attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, without any plan for the morning after other than to kill as many Jews as it could and with no strategy to protect civilians in Gaza from what Hamas knew would be a savage Israeli retaliation. For months now Hamas has also known that if it released its Israeli hostages, agreed that its leadership would leave Gaza and invited an Arab peacekeeping force blessed by the Palestinian Authority to run Gaza instead of Hamas, the suffering of Gazans would stop immediately. But Hamas refuses to do that. It not only wants to keep control of Gaza after any cease-fire; it also wants the United States to guarantee its safety from a resumption of Israeli attacks if and when it gives up the last Israeli hostages, whom Hamas has stashed in tunnels and elsewhere for more than 21 months. This is a sick, twisted organization that bears huge responsibility for the suffering in Gaza. But what too many people still have not grasped is just how sick this current Israeli government is. Too many American officials, lawmakers and Jews keep trying to tell themselves that this is simply another right-wing Israeli government, but just a little more right. Wrong. As I have argued since my column on Nov. 4, 2022, the morning after this Israeli government was elected, which was titled “The Israel We Knew Is Gone,” this Israeli government is uniquely awful. It has empowered the likes of Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who suggested last year that blocking humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip is “justified and moral” even if it causes two million civilians to die of hunger, but that the international community won’t allow him to. “We bring in aid because there is no choice,” Smotrich told a conference hosted by the right-wing Israel Hayom newspaper. “We can’t, in the current global reality, manage a war. Nobody will let us cause two million civilians to die of hunger, even though it might be justified and moral, until our hostages are returned.” This language is worth parsing, because it goes to the core of what Netanyahu has done to Israel. He has brought into the halls of power people like Smotrich, representatives of a dark, long-repressed minority strain in Jewish history. There has been a deep struggle in the Jewish tradition between those who believe that all humans are created in the image of God, and therefore there is something called “humanity” — and that part of the Jewish covenant with God involves protecting all of humanity — and a minority view that argues there is no humanity, per se; there is just “us” and “them.” For the Jewish people to survive and thrive in this region, according to this line of thought, Jews must overcome their humanism, not be guided by it. This minority strain of thinking has always been there, but it had never been given the power it has today. It has never been allowed to direct Israel’s huge advanced war machine. This is Bibi’s unique contribution. He has not only empowered the worst of the worst in Israel but also simultaneously sought to unshackle them from the rule of law. He has engaged in a nonstop campaign to strip power from Israel’s independent, ethical gatekeepers, like the former heads of the Shin Bet security service and the Israeli Army. As I write, Netanyahu is trying to oust Israel’s high-integrity, independent attorney general, after a two-year campaign to undermine the oversight powers of Israel’s Supreme Court, precisely to do something no Israeli government has ever done: formally annex the West Bank, if not Gaza, too — and push out as many Palestinians as possible — without any legal restraints. Trump and his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, have never understood this. They think that everyone is just as transactional as they are — whether it’s Vladimir Putin or Netanyahu — and that deep down everyone wants “peace” first and foremost and not “a piece” of Ukraine or “a piece” of the West Bank or Gaza. That is how Bibi and Putin have, each in their own way, managed to play Trump and Witkoff for fools for so long. What is an example of that? In January, Israel and Hamas agreed to a three-phase cease-fire deal that involved a hostage exchange and a prisoner swap. But Trump and Witkoff let Netanyahu unilaterally break the cease-fire in March, before the last two phases could be negotiated. Bibi cited Hamas’s refusal to meet Israel’s demand to release more hostages before negotiations would resume — even though Hamas was never obligated to do so in Phase 1 of the U.S.-brokered deal. An analysis by Amir Tibon in Haaretz this week headlined “How Trump Facilitated Netanyahu’s Gaza Starvation Policy and Failed to Bring the Hostages Home” argued that there was no military rationale for Bibi to restart the war because Hamas as a military force had been defeated. It was all to serve Bibi’s political needs. Smotrich and the other extremists effectively told Bibi he had to restart the war or be toppled, and Bibi duped Trump and Witkoff into believing he could free the hostages with harsher military blows on Hamas and more hardship for Gazan civilians, and by confining the population to a small corner of the strip. It all turned out to be wrong. Hamas was not defeated, and when Israel eventually had to resume supplying food through its distribution organization, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, it was so bungled that countless Gazans were dying each day swarming the Israeli distribution sites. Hamas, Tibon noted, having seen “that Netanyahu’s blockade and starvation strategy had become a P.R. disaster for Israel, raised its demands in the ongoing hostage negotiations.” The bottom line, he concluded, is this: “Netanyahu dragged Trump and Witkoff into adopting a failed policy — one that returned no living hostages, cost the lives of nearly 50 Israeli soldiers since the war was resumed in March, led to the deaths of thousands of Palestinian civilians and precipitated a full-blown humanitarian disaster. The consequences of this failure will haunt Israel for years.” Alas, it will haunt Palestinians as well, because I fear it has improved the chances that Hamas will come out of this war without having to cede power in Gaza. Bibi and Hamas have been tacitly enabling each other’s political survival for decades. It is quite possible that this disastrous war will end with both of them still in power. If that is the case, say goodbye to any two-state solution and hello to a forever war. Because, to paraphrase the philosopher Immanuel Kant, out of the crooked timber of Bibi and Hamas no straight thing will ever be made.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,9,1726,0.183,0.164,0.072,0.082,0.154,0.155,0.172,0.156,0.121,0.5,0.081
136,45832,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,"If This Mideast War Is Over, Get Ready for Some Interesting Politics","I truly hope this Iran-Israel cease-fire holds and gets extended to Gaza — first and foremost to see an end to all the killing. But second, because I think this war will trigger in its aftermath much-needed debates in Iran, Israel and the Palestinian community. These debates won’t happen the morning the guns fall silent, when leaders from every country involved will try to claim some sort of victory. But everything in my gut tells me these debates will happen the morning after the morning after — when all the internal politics will start to kick in. Among Palestinians in Gaza, the question will be asked of their defeated Hamas leaders: “What in the world were you thinking on Oct. 7, 2023? You started a war with Israel, a vastly superior military foe, with no end game other than destruction, which only got the Jews to retaliate with no end game other than destruction. You sacrificed tens of thousands of homes and lives to win the sympathies of the next generation of global youth on TikTok, but now there is no Gaza.” Among Israelis, the question that will be asked of Israel’s radical religious-nationalist government by the largely secular elements of that society — air force pilots, cyberwarriors, technologists, scientists, weapons designers and Mossad agents, the people who actually defeated Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran — is this: “Where do you think you’re taking us? We were the ones who won this war and we will not let you leverage this victory to win the next election and carry out your plan to crush our Supreme Court, annex the West Bank, excuse the ultra-Orthodox from serving in the army and create a pariah Israel that our kids will no longer want to live in. No way.” And among Iranians, the question that surely will be asked of their clerical leaders and the corrupt Revolutionary Guards: “You spent billions of dollars trying to build a nuclear bomb to threaten Israel and remote-control Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen. But you brought the war home to our country — our families had to flee Tehran and our generals were killed by Israeli drones in their own beds. All you did was destroy a few buildings and kill some civilians in Israel, and when Donald Trump attacked our three key nuclear facilities, your response was to put on a harmless sound and light show over a U.S. air base in Qatar. You were paper tigers, who only knew how to use technology to repress our own people. Meanwhile, our great Persian civilization is destitute, broken and miles behind the rest of the world.” It may not happen overnight, but every bone in my body says these discussions are coming. Because we have never had a war like this in the region. That is, a war in which Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran and Israel are all led by religious nationalists who think God is on their side. A war in which Israel has made Gaza uninhabitable, after being humiliated by Hamas forces that killed more Jews in one day than in any day since the Holocaust. A war in which Israel was able to decapitate and largely destroy Hezbollah as a political force in Lebanon and Syria — where the pro-Iranian militia had helped crush the shoots of democracy since the 1980s. A war that saw Iran’s key nuclear facilities bombed by a U.S. president — something the Iranian mullahs never thought would happen. In short: Everyone went all the way, bursting through psychological and military barriers we never imagined would be breached. If they don’t stop now, or soon, they will all get where they are going: into a forever war — everyone, everywhere, all the time — that will leave nothing and no one unscathed. For all of these reasons, I’m convinced that some very big internal debates are coming — if the wars really stop. For autocratic movements like Hamas or countries like Iran, history teaches us that internally driven regime change happens only after the war is over — and without foreign interventions, said the pollster and political scientist Craig Charney. It has to happen organically by a change in the relationship between the leaders there and those they are leading. “In Serbia in 2000, nationalist president Slobodan Milosevic fell after losing wars in Bosnia and Kosovo when he tried to steal the next election,” Mr. Charney said in an interview. “Iraq’s defeat in the first Gulf War led to a massive revolt against Saddam Hussein that he had to brutally put down. When Argentina’s military junta lost the Falklands War of 1982, it had to allow democracy’s return. And after the Armistice marking Germany’s loss in World War I came the November Revolution that toppled the kaiser. Strongmen don’t look so strong when they’re losers.” The limited polling we have from Gaza, Mr. Charney added, suggests a backlash against Hamas for the catastrophe people there have experienced. There is no polling yet from Iran since the current conflict began, “but social media chatter was reportedly favorable when it began with strikes against unpopular regime figures — and then became more rally-round-the-flag as civilian casualties have mounted,” Mr. Charney said. Now let’s see what happens if the cease-fire holds. All I know for sure is this: Israel is the kind of democracy that Iran’s secular educated elite — part of a rich Persian civilizational legacy — hope this war will pave the way for in Tehran. But an Iranian-style theocracy is precisely what Israel’s secular educated warriors, pilots, scientists and cyber experts want to make sure Israel’s victory doesn’t create in Jerusalem — if there are new elections soon and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition tries to ride this war to victory. As Ari Shavit, an Israeli writer, pointed out to me: The sector of Israeli society that did the most to win the war against Iran “was precisely the same sector that for eight months went out to the streets every Saturday night to prevent Netanyahu’s extreme-right government from destroying Israel’s liberal democracy.” In 1970, Mr. Shavit noted, the Israeli historian Shabtai Teveth wrote a famous book: “The Cursed Blessing: The Story of Israel’s Occupation of the West Bank.” It basically argued that the unintended consequence of the 1967 war was that it unlocked messianic forces in Israeli society. Once the West Bank, the heart of biblical Israel, was back in Israel’s hands, these forces would never consent to return it and would instead insist on settling. And here it is now — still in Israel’s hands 58 years later — with a soul-draining, democracy-eroding occupation. What if, as with the unintended consequences of 1967, Mr. Shavit concluded, “we will look back in 20 years and see that this war made Israel more like Iran is today and made Iran more like the Israel that was before. Because the extremists in Israel were able to take the victory delivered by liberal, democratic, scientific and enlightened Israel and turn this nation into a dark place.” The Palestinian community is also sorely in need of a rethink. The “curse” of the Palestinians is that because their enemy has been the Jews, their plight has always received an inordinate amount of international attention and support that other groups never enjoyed — like the Kurds, who got stuck fighting for a state against Saddam Hussein and Turkey’s Tayyip Erdogan. It’s been a curse because all of that attention as victims often blunted the will of many Palestinians to assume more agency and conduct the kind of hard introspection that repeated military defeats should have stimulated. When students on college campuses all over America are calling to “globalize the intifada,” why bother calling for the return of Salam Fayyad, the most effective nation-building Palestinian leader. Will this time be different? Will the terrible defeat that Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack delivered to Gaza tilt Palestinians to clearly and unambiguously get behind institutional reform of the Palestinian Authority, a demand for professional leadership and support for a demilitarized state along the 1967 lines? I hope so. Will it produce the thing Mr. Netanyahu most wants to avoid the emergence of: a competent, compromising, legitimate Palestinian Authority — i.e., a real partner for peace? Wouldn’t that be ironic. In sum, this regional war for the players in the Middle East was the equivalent of World War II for Europe: It completely shakes up the status quo and opens the way for something new. Whether that new thing will be better or worse within and between the parties to this war is what will be most fascinating — or depressing — for me to watch.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,12,1444,0.493,0.337,0.256,0.353,0.5,0.124,0.274,0.11,0.204,0.5,0.039
137,45830,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,How the Attacks on Iran Are Part of a Much Bigger Global Struggle,"There are so many things to say in the wake of the U.S. bombing of three key Iranian nuclear facilities that it is easy to get lost in the gripping details. So for now, let me try to step back and explore the global, regional and local forces shaping this story. What’s really going on here? It is a very, very big drama, and it is not confined to the Middle East. To my mind, Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, with the sole aim of wiping its democracy off the map and absorbing it into Russia, and the attacks on Israel in 2023 by Hamas and Iran’s proxies in Lebanon, Yemen and Iraq, were manifestations of a global struggle between the forces of inclusion and the forces of resistance. That is a struggle between countries and leaders who see the world and their nations benefiting from more trade, more cooperation against global threats and more decent, if not democratic, governance — versus regimes whose leaders thrive on resisting those trends because conflict enables them to keep their people down, their armies strong and their thieving of their treasuries easy. The forces of inclusion had steadily been growing stronger. Ukraine in 2022 was getting closer to joining the European Union. This would have been the biggest expansion of a whole and free Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, because it would have added to the West a huge agricultural, technological and military power and left Russia more isolated — and looking more out of step to its own people — than ever. At the very same time, the Biden administration was making rapid headway on a deal for the U.S. to forge a security alliance with Saudi Arabia. In return, Saudi Arabia would normalize relations with Israel, and Israel would begin talks with the Palestinians on possible statehood. This would have been the biggest expansion of an integrated Middle East since the Camp David peace treaty between Egypt and Israel in 1979. In short, Ukraine looked poised to join the West, and Israel looked poised to join the East. So what happened? Putin invaded Ukraine to stop the first movement, and Hamas and Iran’s other proxies attacked Israel to stop the second. As such, my first question in the aftermath of Sunday morning’s strike is: Does President Trump understand whose side of this global struggle Putin is on? Iran and Russia are close allies for a reason. Iran has been providing Russia with the drones it has used to more effectively kill Ukrainian soldiers and civilians. I do not ask Trump to drop a bomb on Russia, but I do ask him to provide Ukraine with the military, economic and diplomatic support it needs to resist Russia — every bit as much as the U.S. is doing for Israel to defeat Hamas and Iran. It is all the same war. Putin and the ayatollahs want the exact same kind of world. That is a world safe for autocracy, safe for theocracy, safe for their corruption; a world free from the winds of personal freedoms, the rule of law, a free press; and a world safe for both Russian and Iranian imperialism against independent-minded neighbors. China has always had a foot in each camp. Its economy depends on a healthy and growing world of inclusion, but its political leadership has also maintained strong ties to the world of resistance. So Beijing plays in both leagues — buying oil from Iran but always worried that if Iran got a nuclear bomb, it might one day give a copy to Muslim separatists from Xinjiang. That said, China’s oil purchases from Iran are a crucial part of this story. Those purchases are Tehran’s biggest source of external income, which has enabled it to finance Hamas, Hezbollah and (until recently) Syria. As my colleague Keith Bradsher reported from Shanghai, oil sales to China are today 6 percent of Iran’s economy and equal to about half of government spending. Now let’s look at this struggle from a purely Middle East angle. Here I happen to have a very personal perspective. By pure coincidence, I began my career as a cub foreign correspondent for U.P.I. in Beirut in 1979. Here are the four big stories that I covered that first year, on my manual typewriter: the Islamic Revolution in Iran toppling the shah, the takeover of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by puritanical jihadists trying to overthrow the Saudi ruling family, the signing of the Camp David peace treaty between Israel and Egypt and, less well known but no less important, the opening of Jebel Ali Port in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, which would become one of the largest in the world. It would emerge as the global hub that would connect the Arab East — through trade, tourism, services, shipping, investments and world-class airlines — with almost every corner of the planet. It opened a hugely significant door through which the globalization of the Arab world just took off. And thus began a titanic regional struggle between the forces of inclusion and resistance in the Middle East. On one side were those states that were ready to accept Israel, provided that it made progress with the Palestinians, and that also sought to integrate the region more intimately with the West and the East. On the other side stood the forces of resistance led by Iran, the Muslim Brotherhood and various puritanical, jihadist Sunni movements that originally incubated in post-1979 Saudi Arabia and later spread their influence to mosques across the region. They all sought to drive Western influences out of the area, Israel out of existence and the pro-American governments — like those of Jordan, Egypt and the Saudi ruling family — out of power. The U.S. and Israel fought this war with their armies, while groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS did so with terrorist cells and Iran did so by slowly creating a network of proxy armies in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Iraq that enabled Iran to indirectly control all four countries — and to even gain a toehold in the West Bank and Gaza. Tehran never had to risk a single soldier; it let Syrians, Lebanese, Iraqis, Yemenis and Palestinians die for its interests. Yes, the problems in the Middle East were the product of not just Israeli occupation but also Iranian imperialism — among other things. A couple of years ago, I quoted Nadim Koteich, a Lebanese Emirati political analyst and the general manager of Sky News Arabia, who said that Iran’s resistance network sought “to bridge militias, rejectionists, religious sects and sectarian leaders.” The goal was to create an anti-Israel, anti-American, anti-Western axis that could simultaneously pressure Israel in Gaza, in the West Bank and on the Lebanon border — as well as the United States in the Red Sea, in Syria and in Iraq and Saudi Arabia from all directions. In contrast, Koteich added, the U.S., its Arab allies and Israel sought to weave together and integrate global and regional markets — instead of battle fronts — that featured business conferences, news organizations, elites, investment funds, tech incubators and major trade routes. This inclusion network transcended traditional boundaries, “creating a web of economic and technological interdependence that has the potential to redefine power structures and create new paradigms of regional stability,” he said. Those who caution against regime change in Tehran often point to Iraq as a cautionary tale. But that analogy is flawed. America’s nation-building effort in Iraq failed for years largely (but not exclusively) because of Iran, not in spite of it. Tehran, with the help of its proxy in Syria, did everything it could to sabotage regime change in Iraq, knowing that if the U.S. was successful in creating a multisectarian, reasonably democratic, secular government in Baghdad, it would be a huge threat to Iran’s theocracy, just as a successful pro-Western Ukrainian democracy would be a huge threat to Putin’s kleptocracy. By the way, no one knows that better than the new, frail, democratic government in Syria, which has been reluctant to condemn Israel’s bombing of Iran. That is a sign that the Syrians know who kept their tyrant, Bashar al-Assad in power, all those years: Iran.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,13,1377,0.123,0.242,0.103,0.5,0.5,0.207,0.348,0.5,0.359,0.5,0.453
138,45824,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,The Smart Way for Trump to End the Israel-Iran War,"Behind the strikes and counterstrikes in the current Israel-Iran war stands the clash of two strategic doctrines, one animating Iran and the other animating Israel, that are both deeply flawed. President Trump has a chance to correct both of them and to create the best opportunity for stabilizing the Middle East in decades — if he is up to it. Iran’s flawed strategic doctrine, which was also practiced by its proxy, Hezbollah, to equally bad results, is a doctrine I call trying to out-crazy an adversary. Iran and Hezbollah are always ready to go all the way, thinking that whatever their opponents might do in response, Hezbollah or Iran will always outdo them with a more extreme measure. You name it — assassinate the prime minister of Lebanon, Rafik Hariri; blow up the American Embassy in Beirut; help Bashar al-Assad murder thousands of his own people to stay in power — the imprints of Iran and its Hezbollah proxy are behind them all, together or separately. They are telling the world in effect: “No one will out-crazy us, so beware if you get in a fight with us, you will lose. Because we go all the way — and you moderates just go away.” That Iranian doctrine did help Hezbollah drive Israel out of southern Lebanon. But where it fell short was Iran and Hezbollah thinking they could drive Israelis out of their biblical homeland. Iran and Hezbollah are delusional in this regard — Hamas, too. They keep referring to the Jewish state as a foreign colonial enterprise, with no indigenous connection to the land, and therefore they assume the Jews will eventually meet the same fate as the Belgians in the Belgian Congo. That is, under enough pressure they will eventually go back to their own version of Belgium. But the Israeli Jews have no Belgium. They are as indigenous to their biblical homeland as the Palestinians, no matter what “anticolonial” nonsense they teach at elite universities. Therefore, you will never out-crazy the Israeli Jews. If push comes to shove, they will out-crazy you. They will play by the local rules, and yes, those are not the rules of the Geneva Conventions. They are the rules of the Middle East, which I call Hama Rules — named after the Hama attacks perpetrated by the Syrian government of Hafez al-Assad in 1982, the aftermath of which I covered. Al-Assad wiped out the Muslim Brotherhood in Hama by mercilessly leveling whole swaths of the city, whole blocks of apartments, into a parking lot. Hama rules are no rules at all. The former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, both thought that they could out-crazy the Israeli Jews, that Israel would never try to kill them personally, that Israel was, as Nasrallah liked to say, a “spider web” that would just unravel one day under pressure. He paid with his life with that miscalculation last year, and the supreme leader probably would have as well if Trump had not intervened, reportedly, last week to stop Israel from killing him. These Israeli Jews will not be out-crazied. That is how they still have a state in a very tough neighborhood. That said, Benjamin Netanyahu and his band of extremists running the Israeli government today are in the grip of their own strategic fallacy, which I call the doctrine of “once and for all.” I wish I had a dollar for every time, after some murderous attack on Israeli Jews by Palestinians or Iranian proxies, the Israeli government declared that it was going to solve the problem with force “once and for all.” There are only two ways to finish off this problem once and for all. One is for Israel to permanently occupy the West Bank, Gaza and all of Iran, as America did to Germany and Japan after World War II, and try to change the political culture. But Israel has no chance of occupying all of Iran, and it has occupied the West Bank for 58 years and still has not wiped out Hamas’s influence there — let alone secular Palestinian nationalism. That is because Palestinians are every bit as indigenous as the Jews in their homeland. Israel will never “once and for all” them into submission, unless they kill every last one. The only way to even get close to ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict “once and for all” is by working toward a two-state solution. Which brings me to what Trump should do now regarding Iran. He says he still hopes “there’s going to be a deal.” If he wants a good deal, he should declare that he is doing two things at once. One, that he will equip Israel’s Air Force with the B-2 bombers and 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs and U.S. trainers that would give Israel the capacity to destroy all of Iran’s underground nuclear facilities unless Iran immediately agrees to allow teams from the International Atomic Energy Agency to disassemble these facilities and to have access into every nuclear site in Iran to recover all fissile material that Tehran has generated. Only if Iran completely complies with these conditions should it be allowed to have a civilian nuclear program under strict IAEA controls. But Iran will comply only under a credible threat of force. At the same time, Trump should declare that his administration recognizes the Palestinians as a people who have a right to national self-determination. But to realize that, they must demonstrate that they can fulfill the responsibilities of statehood by generating a new Palestinian Authority leadership that the United States deems credible, free of corruption and committed both to effectively serving Palestinian citizens in the West Bank and Gaza and to coexisting with Israel. Trump must also make clear, though, that he will not tolerate the rapid settlement expansion and one-state reality that Israel is now creating, which is a prescription for a forever war because Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza won’t disappear or “once and for all” give up their national identity and aspirations. (At the end of May the Netanyahu government approved 22 new Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank — the largest expansion in decades — which is simply insane.) To that end, Trump could also say that his administration will be committed to sponsoring peace talks for a two-state solution — with the Trump peace plan for a pathway toward two states from his previous presidency as the minimum starting point but not ending point. That, the parties themselves must negotiate directly. To be ready to out-crazy the crazies has been a necessary condition for Israel to survive in the Middle East, but it is not a sufficient one. As the Gaza war demonstrates, that strategy just begets more of the same. Even if it seems unfair at times, even if it seems naïve at times, a peace-loving nation has to keep exploring alternatives and pairing force with diplomacy. It’s not only the best policy for Israel vis-à-vis the Palestinians; it’s also the best way for Israel and America to isolate Iran. As such, if Trump really wants to forge peace in the Middle East, which I believe he does, America must not become Netanyahu’s captive or Iran’s patsy. The United States has no interest in making Israel safe for messianic expansion or Iran safe for nuclear messianism. Trump must ignore the dangerous, knee-jerk isolationism of JD Vance. And he must eschew the equally foolish Netanyahu-can-do-no-wrong advice of G.O.P. armchair generals and evangelicals. Neither serves U.S. interests or credibility in the region. The necessary but not sufficient conditions for peace in the Middle East that will allow America to reduce, but not end, its military presence there are that Iran be forced to draw a clear western border and stop trying to colonize its Arab neighbors and destroy Israel with a nuclear bomb, that Israel be forced to draw a clear eastern border and stop trying to colonize the whole of the West Bank and that Palestinians be forced to draw clear eastern and western borders between Israel and Jordan and stop with the “river to the sea” nonsense. This war has created the best opportunity in decades for a wise statesman to use what Dennis Ross, a longtime Middle East negotiator, calls in his new book, Statecraft 2.0, “coercive diplomacy.” Is Trump up to that?

139,45821,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,How to Think About What’s Happening With Iran and Israel,"The full-scale Israeli attack on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure on Friday needs to be added to the list of pivotal, game-changing wars that have reshaped the Middle East since World War II and are known by just their dates — 1956, 1967, 1973, 1982, 2023 — and now 2025. It is far too early, and the possible outcomes so multifold, to say how the Middle East game of nations will be changed by the Israel-Iran conflict of 2025. All I would say now is that the extreme upside possibility (that this puts in motion a set of falling dominoes, ending with the toppling of the Iranian regime and its replacement by a more decent, secular and consensual one) and the extreme downside possibility (that it sets the whole region on fire and sucks in the United States) are both on the table. Between these extremes still lies a middle-ground possibility — a negotiated solution — but not for long. President Trump has deftly used the Israeli attack to, in effect, say to the Iranians: “I am still ready to negotiate a peaceful end to your nuclear program and you might want to go there fast — because my friend Bibi is C-R-A-Z-Y. I am waiting for your call.” Given this wide range of possibilities, the best thing that I can offer to those watching at home are the key variables that I will be tracking to determine which of these — or some other I can’t anticipate — is the most likely outcome. First: What makes this Iran-Israel conflict so profound is Israel’s vow to continue the fight this time until it eliminates Iran’s nuclear weapon-making capability — one way or another. Iran invited that, vastly accelerating its enrichment of uranium to near weapons grade. It had begun aggressively disguising those efforts to such a new degree that even the International Atomic Energy Agency declared on Thursday that Iran was not complying with its nuclear nonproliferation obligations, the first time the agency has declared that in 20 years. Israel has cocked its gun and aimed at the Iranian nuclear program several times in the past 15 years, but each time either under U.S. pressure or doubts by its own military, it stood down at the last minute — which is why it is impossible to exaggerate what is happening today. Second: The big technical question I have is whether Israel’s bombing of Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities, like Natanz, which is buried deep underground, induced sufficient concussive shock to the centrifuges used to enrich uranium — and overcome their shock absorbers — to make them inoperable at least for a while. If nothing else, one has to assume that the Israeli strike most likely bombed the entries to underground facilities to slow down their work. The Israeli Army spokesman said Israel inflicted significant damage to Natanz, Iran’s biggest enrichment facility, but it’s less clear how Fordow, another enrichment facility, might have been affected, if at all. If Israel succeeds in damaging the Iranian nuclear project enough to force at least a temporary halt to its enrichment operations, that would certainly be a significant military gain for Israel, justifying the operation. Third: What actually interests me just as much is the impact this conflict could have on the region — particularly Iran’s longstanding, malign influence over Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen, where Tehran nurtured and armed local militias to indirectly control those countries and ensure that they never moved toward pro-Western consensual governments. Removing the dead hand of Iran from the neck of these regimes, which began with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision to decapitate and cripple Iran’s Hezbollah militia, has already paid dividends in Lebanon and Syria, where new, pluralistic leaders have taken power. Alas, they are both still in a frail state, but they have hope — in Iraq as well — that did not exist before. And their escape from Iran’s sphere of influence has been broadly popular among their people. Fourth: One of the things that has always struck me about Netanyahu is his strategic acumen as a player in the regional theater and his strategic incompetence as a local player vis-à-vis the Palestinians. It is because as a regional player his mind is for the most part unencumbered by ideological and political constraints. But as a local player in Gaza, for instance, his decision-making is not just influenced by, but dominated by, his personal political survival needs, his ideological commitment to preventing a Palestinian state under any condition and his dependence on the crazy right in Israel to stay in power. He has therefore mired the Israeli Army in the quicksand of Gaza — a moral, economic and strategic disaster — with no plan for how to get out. Fifth: If you are asking yourself how this conflict might affect your retirement investments, the thing to watch most closely is whether Iran tries to destabilize the Trump administration by taking actions to deliberately drive the price of oil into the stratosphere — and create inflation in the West. For instance, Iran could sink a couple of oil or gas tankers in the Strait of Hormuz or fill it with sea mines, effectively blockading oil and gas exports. Just that prospect is already pushing up oil prices. Sixth: How is Israeli intelligence on Iran so good that it pinpointed the locations of and killed its two top military leaders, not to mention a number of other senior officers? Of course, the Mossad and the Israeli NSA cybercommand, Unit 8200, are very good at what they do. But if you want to know their real secret, watch the streaming series “Tehran” on Apple TV+. It fictionalizes the work of an Israeli Mossad agent in Tehran. What you learn from that series, which is also true in real life, is how many Iranian officials are ready to work for Israel because of how much they hate their own government. This clearly makes it relatively easy for Israel to recruit agents in the Iranian government and military at the highest levels. This reality not only pays first-order dividends like the precise targeting manifested in Friday’s strike but also produces a second-order advantage for Israel: Every time Iran’s military and political leaders gather to plan operations against Israel, each one has to ask himself if the person sitting next to him is an Israeli agent. That really slows down planning and innovation. Add to this the fact that Iran’s supreme leader just saw his two top generals assassinated — the chief of staff of the armed forces and the commander in chief of the Revolutionary Guards. He surely realizes that Israel could eliminate him. One has to assume, therefore, he is hiding deep in a bunker somewhere, which also has to slow down decision-making. Seventh: If Israel fails in this endeavor — and by failure I mean this Iranian regime is wounded but is still able to reconstitute its ability to build a nuclear weapon and try to control Arab capitals — it could mean a war of attrition between the two most powerful militaries in the region. This would make the region even more unstable than ever, spiking oil crises and possibly prompting Iran to lash out and attack pro-America Arab regimes and U.S. forces in the area. That would leave the Trump administration no choice but to jump in, probably with the goal of not just ending that war but ending this Iranian regime. Then who knows what would happen. Last, unlike in Gaza, Israel has gone out of its way to avoid killing large numbers of Iranian citizens, because ultimately Israel wants them to take out their rage on their regime for squandering so many resources building a nuclear weapon — and not on Israel. Speaking in English in a video shortly after the attack, Netanyahu addressed the Iranian people directly: “We do not hate you. You are not our enemies. We have a common enemy: a tyrannical regime that tramples you. For nearly 50 years, this regime has robbed you of the chance for a good life.” Iranians are not going to be inspired by Netanyahu, but there should be no doubt that this was already an unpopular regime and you can’t predict what might happen now that it has been militarily humiliated by Israel. It was only three years ago that Iran’s clerical regime arrested over 20,000 people and killed over 500, including some who were executed, in an effort to stamp out a popular uprising that exploded after the regime’s “morality police” detained a 22-year-old woman, Mahsa Amini, because she had not fully covered her hair underneath a compulsory veil. She died in custody. Looking forward, the two most important lessons one can derive from history are: Regimes like Iran’s look strong, until they don’t — so they can go quickly. And in the Middle East, the opposite of autocracy is not necessarily democracy. It can also be prolonged disorder. So as much as I would like to see this government be toppled, beware of the falling pillars.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10,1511,0.345,0.234,0.321,0.401,0.646,0.5,0.333,0.287,0.14,0.5,0.576
140,45818,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,This Israeli Government Is a Danger to Jews Everywhere,"Israelis, diaspora Jewry and friends of Israel everywhere need to understand that the way Israel is fighting the war in Gaza today is laying the groundwork for a fundamental recasting of how Israel and Jews will be seen the world over. It won’t be good. Police cars and private security at synagogues and Jewish institutions will increasingly become the norm; Israel, instead of being seen by Jews as a safe haven from antisemitism, will be seen as a new engine generating it; sane Israelis will line up to immigrate to Australia and America rather than beckon their fellow Jews to come Israel’s way. That dystopian future is not here yet, but if you don’t see its outlines gathering, you are deluding yourself. Fortunately, more and more retired and reserve duty Israeli Air Force pilots, as well as retired Army and security officers, are seeing this gathering storm and declaring they will not be silent or complicit in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s ugly, nihilistic policy in Gaza. They have begun to urge Jews in America and elsewhere to speak up — SOS: Save Our Ship — before the widening moral stain of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza becomes irreversible. First, the back story: Israel months ago destroyed Hamas as an existential military threat. Given that, the Netanyahu government should be telling the Trump administration and Arab mediators that it’s ready to withdraw from Gaza in a phased manner and be replaced by an international/Arab/Palestinian Authority peacekeeping force — provided that the Hamas leadership agrees to return all remaining living and dead hostages and leave the strip. If instead, though, Israel goes ahead with Netanyahu’s vow to perpetuate this war indefinitely — to try to achieve “total victory” over every last Hamasnik, along with the far right’s fantasy of ridding Gaza of Palestinians and resettling it with Israelis — Jews worldwide better prepare themselves, their children and their grandchildren for a reality they’ve never known: to be Jewish in a world where the Jewish state is a pariah state — a source of shame, not of pride. Because one day, foreign photographers and reporters will be allowed to go into Gaza unescorted by the Israeli Army. And when they do, and the full horror of the destruction there becomes clear to all, the backlash against Israel and Jews everywhere could be profound. Do not confuse my warning to Israel for a shred of understanding for what Hamas did on Oct. 7, 2023. Hamas invited the Israeli response with its own mass killings of Israeli parents in front of their children, children in front of their parents, by kidnapping grandmothers and murdering kidnapped children. What society in the world would not see its heart grow cold by such brutality? Hamas deserves to be eliminated; Hamas is and always has been a cancer on the Palestinian people, let alone Israelis. But as a Jew who believes in the right of the Jewish people to live in a secure state in their biblical homeland — alongside a secure Palestinian state — I am focused right now on my own tribe. And if my own tribe does not resist this Israeli government’s utter indifference to the number of civilians being killed in Gaza today — as well its attempt to tilt Israel into authoritarianism at home by moving to sack its independent attorney general — Jews everywhere will pay dearly. Don’t just take that warning from me. Last week two respected former Israeli Air Force pilots, Brig. Gen. Asaf Agmon and Col. Uri Arad (who was a P.O.W. in Egypt during the October 1973 war), published an open letter in Hebrew in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, addressed to their colleagues still serving in the Air Force. Both men are members of Forum 555 Patriots, an impressive group of around 1,700 Israeli Air Force pilots, some retired and some still serving as reservists, which originally formed to resist Netanyahu’s efforts to undermine Israeli democracy with a judicial coup. A Forum 555 leader, the retired Israeli Air Force helicopter pilot Guy Poran, sent me Agmon and Arad’s letter to see if I could get it published as a Times Opinion guest essay. I told them I wanted to publish an excerpt myself. They wrote: We do not seek to downplay the monstrous nature of the massacre committed by Hamas terrorists on that cursed Saturday. We believe the war was fully justified. … However, as the war in Gaza dragged on, it became clear that it was losing its strategic and security purposes and instead served primarily the political and personal interests of the government. It thus became an unmistakably immoral war, and increasingly appeared to be a war of revenge. … The Air Force has become a tool for those, in government and even in the military, who claim that there are no innocent people in Gaza. … Recently, a member of the Knesset even boasted that one of the government’s achievements is the ability to kill 100 people a day in Gaza without anyone being shocked. In response to such statements, we say: As horrific as the Oct. 7 massacre was, it does not justify complete disregard for moral considerations or the disproportionate use of deadly force. We do not want to become like the worst of our enemies. The climax came on the night of March 18, with the resumption of war after the Israeli government knowingly chose to violate the agreement for the return of hostages. In a deadly airstrike intended to kill several Hamas commanders (reports vary on whether there were dozens or fewer), a new record was set. The munitions dropped by Air Force pilots on the target killed approximately 300 people, including many children. No satisfactory explanation has been given so far for the horrifying outcome of the attack. Since then, the Air Force has continued its relentless strikes on Gaza. … Entire buildings with children, women, and civilians are bombed — ostensibly to eliminate terrorists or destroy terror infrastructure. Even if some targets are legitimate, the disproportionate harm to uninvolved civilians cannot be denied. … This is a moment of reckoning. It is not too late. We call on our fellow active duty pilots: Do not continue to avoid asking questions. … Because you are the ones who will have to bear the moral consequences of your actions for the rest of your lives. You will have to face your children and grandchildren and explain how such unimaginable destruction occurred in Gaza, how so many innocent children perished by the deadly killing machine you piloted. Just a few hours after I got the letter, Nimrod Novik, a senior foreign policy adviser to former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, sent me another open letter, dated June 8. This one was from Commanders for Israel’s Security, urging Jewish diaspora voices to speak up against the madness in Gaza before they too are consumed by it. It read, in part: As Commanders for Israel’s Security, a movement of over 550 retired senior officials from Israel’s defense, security and diplomatic services, our lifelong mission has been to secure the future of Israel as the strong, democratic home of the Jewish people. … Recent events have led to passionate and sometimes painful debates within Jewish communities worldwide, particularly regarding the situation in Gaza. Many in the diaspora have voiced concerns publicly. Consequently, some have faced harsh criticism. Accused of weakening Israel or betraying their connection to the Jewish state, they are told that those who live abroad or do not serve in the I.D.F. must keep silent. We categorically reject the notion that Jews in the diaspora must remain silent on matters concerning Israel. … To those who fear that public criticism undermines Israel, we say that open, honest dialogue only reinforces our democracy and our security. I have three reactions to these open letters: First, Amen. Second, this is what being pro-Israel really sounds like. Third, it is time for a similar movement calling out Hamas’s vile excesses, led by those who support Palestinian statehood and a peaceful resolution in Gaza. No one should accept Hamas prolonging this war to keep itself in power. Nothing would do more to pressure Hamas to accept a cease-fire than to be denounced across the world, on college campuses and in high-profile demonstrations from those who have been giving this hate-driven organization a free pass. This is what being pro-Palestinian really sounds like.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,9,1405,0.036,0.178,0.102,0.509,0.5,0.21,0.351,0.372,0.342,0.5,0.479
141,45804,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,The Flashing Signals That I Just Saw in Israel,"I just spent a week in Israel and, while it may not look as if much has changed — the grinding Gaza war continues to grind — I felt something new there for the first time since Oct. 7, 2023. It is premature to call it a broad-based antiwar movement, which can happen only when all the Israeli hostages are returned. But I did see signals flashing that more Israelis, from the left to the center and to even parts of the right, are concluding that continuing this war is a disaster for Israel: morally, diplomatically or strategically. From the political center, the former prime minister Ehud Olmert wrote an essay in the newspaper Haaretz in which he pulled no punches against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his coalition. “The government of Israel is currently waging a war without purpose, without goals or clear planning and with no chances of success,” Olmert argued. “What we are doing in Gaza now is a war of devastation: indiscriminate, limitless, cruel and criminal killing of civilians.” His conclusion: “Yes, Israel is committing war crimes.” From the right, you have the likes of Amit Halevi, a member of Netanyahu’s own right-wing Likud party, who is staunchly pro-war but thinks its execution has been bungled. Halevi had his membership on the Knesset’s foreign affairs and defense committee suspended by Netanyahu’s coalition after he voted against a proposal to extend the government’s ability to issue emergency call-up orders for Israeli reservists. In an interview with the newspaper Yediot Ahronot following his dismissal, Halevi said: “This war is a deception. They lied to us about its achievements.” Israel has “been fighting a war for 20 months with failed plans” and it “is not succeeding in destroying Hamas.” And from the left, Yair Golan, the leader of Israel’s liberal alliance, called the Democrats, stated in an interview with Israel Radio: “Israel is on the way to becoming a pariah state, like South Africa was, if we don’t return to acting like a sane country. A sane country does not fight against civilians, does not kill babies as a hobby, and does not set itself the aim of expelling populations.” After the “hobby” comment drew an outcry, Golan, himself a Gaza war hero, clarified that he was not blaming the military, but rather the politicians who were extending the war for reasons that no longer have anything to do with Israel’s national security needs. While Golan probably should have used a different word, so as not to give Israeli rightists an easy way to discredit him, the truth is this: Virtually no independent foreign journalists have been allowed to report firsthand from Gaza — unescorted by the Israeli army. When this war is over and Gaza is saturated with international reporters and photographers free to roam, the level of death and destruction is going to be fully reported and pictured — and that is going to be a very bad time for Israel and world Jewry. So, Golan was right to warn his nation — bluntly — to stop now, forge a cease-fire, get the hostages back, get an international and Arab force into Gaza and deal with the remnants of Hamas later. When you are in a hole, stop digging. Unfortunately, Netanyahu has insisted on continuing to dig, claiming that he can bomb Hamas into giving up its remaining 20 or so living Israeli hostages — and because the religious-nationalist members of his coalition have essentially told him if he stops the war, they will topple him. So, the Israeli military is going after more and more secondary targets, and the result is Gazan civilians being killed every day. Amos Harel, the military analyst for Haaretz, explained why: “Many bombing runs are actually assassination attempts against Hamas leaders, often when they’re with their families. And these officials no longer live in private houses or apartment buildings — they’re usually in the crowded tent camps with thousands of civilians. Even when the army declares multiple steps of caution, these attacks result in massive killing.” It is not only, and indeed not even mostly, the rise in Gazan civilian casualties that is turning more and more Israelis against the war. It’s simply that the war has worn down the whole society. The signs, Harel notes, are everything from “an increasing number of suicides (which the army doesn’t report) to families that are breaking up and businesses that are collapsing. The government conveniently ignores these developments and scatters promises of victory instead.” And it’s not only the voices of adult politicians who tell you that Israel has been too long at war. It’s the innocent actions of 4-year-olds, too. During my trip, I heard a story from the popular Israeli anchor Lucy Aharish, the first Israeli Arab Muslim news presenter on mainstream Hebrew-language television. She and I had both arrived at a dialogue we did together in Tel Aviv a bit bleary eyed because around 3 a.m. we had each been awakened by the wail of air raid sirens telling us to take cover from a Houthi missile attack. There is something distinctive and particularly nerve-jangling about this air raid siren, but you have to be an adult to detect it. Why do I say that? Well, every year Israel commemorates the fallen soldiers and civilians of its wars with a two-minute wail of a siren. Wherever they are, Israelis stop, pull off the road and stand in silence for this siren, which is a steady blare, not the wave used for air raid warnings. On the commemoration this year, Aharish told me, the national siren went off at the designated time, and “my 4-year-old son, Adam, who was playing on the floor, started to panic and immediately began gathering up his toys to go into the safe room in our house.” “I told him, ‘No, you don’t have to. This is a different siren. For this siren we stand in respect for superheroes who kept us safe and are no longer with us.’” When 4-year-olds must learn to distinguish the difference between siren wails — those that you stand in respect for and those you need to gather your toys for and rush for a room with no windows — you have been too long at war. If many Israelis feel trapped by their own leaders, many Gazans clearly feel the same. Polling in Gaza is obviously difficult, but the antiwar movement there seems to be stirring as well — although there you can get killed by Hamas for protesting. A survey by the independent, Ramallah-based Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research of people across the Gaza Strip found that 48 percent supported the anti-Hamas demonstrations that erupted in several places in recent weeks. Indeed, be assured, it’s not only some Israeli leaders who will face a reckoning when the guns of Gaza finally fall silent. Hamas’s leaders will live in infamy. They attacked Israeli border communities on Oct. 7, 2023, and, when Israel predictably retaliated, they essentially offered up Gaza’s civilians as a collective human sacrifice to win global sympathy for their cause — while Hamas’s leaders hid in tunnels and abroad. Hamas is still operating, but now Gaza is unlivable. And yet, Hamas’s leadership is still stubbornly saying it will not turn over all its remaining live hostages unless Israel agrees to leave Gaza and return to an open-ended cease-fire. Really? Israel should leave all of Gaza and accept a cease-fire? What a great idea. If Hamas achieved that “victory,” it would mean that Hamas fought this entire war — losing tens of thousands of fighters and civilians and having few buildings in Gaza left intact — in order to get back to exactly what Hamas had on Oct. 6, 2023: a cease-fire and Israel out of Gaza. For this alone, history will remember Hamas’s leaders as mendacious fools. They thought they were unleashing an apocalypse on Israel and instead unleashed an apocalypse on their own people that also ended up giving license to Netanyahu to destroy their ally, Hezbollah, in Lebanon and Syria, which weakened Iran’s grip on both of those nations, as well as on Iraq, and helped drive Russia out of Syria. It was a rout of the Iran-led “resistance network.” But here’s the rub. As a result of Netanyahu’s military operations, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah — not to mention Saudi Arabia — are all now much freer to join the Abraham Accords and normalize relations with Israel to a degree they never were when Iran’s regional mercenary network was so powerful. Yes, Netanyahu made that happen! But he also never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity for peace. Netanyahu today staunchly refuses to harvest what Netanyahu has sown. He will not do the one thing that would unlock the politics of the whole region: open a road, no matter how long, to a two-state solution with a reformed Palestinian Authority. No wonder Donald Trump doesn’t want to waste time with Netanyahu — he can’t make any money from him and Netanyahu won’t allow Trump to make any history with him. The more I would argue to Israelis that Netanyahu is making a historic mistake — trading peace with Saudi Arabia for peace with the far-right extremists who keep him in power — the more they would ask me: “Do you think Trump can save us?” That question is the ultimate sign that your democracy is in trouble. I had to explain that Trump goes to countries that give him things — cash, 747s, $Trump meme coin and Official Melania Meme sales, arms purchases, hotel deals, golf courses, A.I. data centers — and not countries that ask him for things, like Israel...When Netanyahu was elected in November 2022 and began forming his Jewish supremacist coalition, I wrote a column the next morning headlined, “The Israel We Knew Is Gone.” I hope I was premature — but I hope even more that I won’t soon have to write the same column about America. The year 2026 will have a lot to say about whether the Netanyahu and Trump cults can be contained. That year, Netanyahu will have to hold national elections and Trump will have to face the midterms. Those committed to democracy and decency in both countries have one job between now and then: organize, organize, organize to win power. Nothing else matters. And everything is riding on it.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,9,1741,0.346,0.558,0.388,0.235,0.5,0.092,0.415,0.556,0.406,0.5,0.139
142,45786,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,This Israeli Government Is Not Our Ally,"Dear President Trump, There are very few initiatives that you’ve undertaken since coming to office that I agree with — except in the Middle East. The fact that you are traveling there next week and meeting the leaders of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar — and that you have no plans to see Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel — suggests to me that you are starting to understand a vital truth: that this Israeli government is behaving in ways that threaten hard-core U.S. interests in the region. Netanyahu is not our friend. He did think he could make you his chump, though. Which is why I am impressed by how you have signaled to him through your independent negotiations with Hamas, Iran and the Houthis that he has no purchase on you — that you will not be his patsy. It clearly has him in a panic. I have no doubt that, generally speaking, the Israeli people continue to see themselves as steadfast allies of the American people — and vice versa. But this ultranationalist, messianic Israeli government is not America’s ally. Because this is the first government in Israel’s history whose priority is not peace with more of its Arab neighbors and the benefits that greater security and coexistence would bring. Its priority is the annexation of the West Bank, the expulsion of the Palestinians of Gaza and the re-establishment there of Israeli settlements. The notion that Israel has a government that is no longer behaving as an American ally, and should not be considered as such, is a shocking and bitter pill for Israel’s friends in Washington to swallow — but swallow it they must. Because in pursuit of its extremist agenda this Netanyahu government is undermining our interests. The fact that you are not letting Netanyahu run over you the way he has other U.S. presidents is a credit to you. It is also vital to defend the U.S. security architecture your predecessors have built in the region. The structure of the current U.S.-Arab-Israel alliance was established by Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger after the 1973 October War, to push out Russia and make America the dominant global power in the region, which has served our geopolitical and economic interests ever since. The Nixon-Kissinger diplomacy forged the 1974 disengagement agreements between Israel, Syria and Egypt. Those laid the foundations for the Camp David peace treaty. Camp David laid the groundwork for the Oslo Peace Accords. The result was a region dominated by America, its Arab allies and Israel. But this whole structure depended to a large degree on a U.S.-Israeli commitment to a two-state solution of some kind — a commitment that you yourself tried to advance in your first term with your own plan for a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank next to Israel — on the condition that the Palestinians agreed to recognize Israel and accept that their state would be demilitarized. This Netanyahu government, however, made annexation of the West Bank its priority when it came to power in late 2022 — well before Hamas’s vicious invasion on Oct. 7, 2023 — rather than the U.S. security-peace architecture for the region. For almost a year, the Biden administration beseeched Netanyahu to do one thing for America and for Israel: agree to open a dialogue with the Palestinian Authority about a two-state solution one day with a reformed authority — in return for Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel. That would then pave the way for passage in Congress of a U.S.-Saudi security treaty to counterbalance Iran and freeze out China. Netanyahu refused to do it, because the Jewish supremacists in his cabinet said if he did so they would topple his government — and with Netanyahu on trial on multiple charges of corruption, he could not afford to give up the protection of being prime minister to drag out his trial and forestall a possible jail term. So, Netanyahu put his personal interests ahead of Israel’s and America’s. Normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, the most important Muslim power — built on an effort to forge a two-state solution with moderate Palestinians — would have opened the whole Muslim world to Israeli tourists, investors and innovators, eased tensions between Jews and Muslims the world over and consolidated U.S. advantages in the Middle East set in motion by Nixon and Kissinger for another decade or more. After Netanyahu’s spinning everyone for two years, both the Americans and Saudis have reportedly decided to give up on Israel’s involvement in the deal — a true loss for both Israelis and the Jewish people. Reuters reported Thursday that “the United States is no longer demanding Saudi Arabia normalize ties with Israel as a condition for progress on civil nuclear cooperation talks.” And now it may get worse. Netanyahu is preparing to re-invade Gaza with a plan to herd the Palestinian population there into a tiny corner, with the Mediterranean Sea one side and the Egyptian border on the other — while also advancing de facto annexation at ever greater speed and breadth in the West Bank. In doing so it will be courting more war crimes charges against Israel (and particularly against its new army chief of staff, Eyal Zamir) that Bibi will expect your administration to protect him from. I have zero sympathy for Hamas. I think it is a sick organization that has done enormous damage to the Palestinian cause. It is hugely responsible for the human tragedy that is Gaza today. Hamas’s leadership should have released its hostages and left Gaza a long time ago, removing any excuse for Israel to resume the fighting. But Netanyahu’s plan to reinvade Gaza is not to stand up a moderate alternative to Hamas, led by the Palestinian Authority. It is for a permanent Israeli military occupation, whose unstated goal will be to pressure all Palestinians to leave. That is a prescription for a permanent insurgency — Vietnam on the Mediterranean. Addressing a conference on May 5 sponsored by the religious Zionist newspaper B’Sheva, Bezalel Smotrich, Israel’s far right finance minister, spoke like a man who couldn’t care less what you think: “We’re occupying Gaza to stay,” he said. “There will be no more entering and leaving.” The local population will be squeezed into a less than a quarter of the Gaza Strip. As the Haaretz military expert Amos Harel noted: “Since the army will try to minimize casualties, analysts expect it to use particularly aggressive force that will lead to extensive damage to Gaza’s remaining civilian infrastructure. The displacement of the population to the areas of the humanitarian camps, combined with the ongoing shortage of food and medicine, could lead to further mass deaths of civilians. … More Israeli leaders and officers could face personal legal proceedings against them.” Indeed, this strategy, if executed, may not only trigger more war crime accusations against Israel, but will also inevitably threaten the stability of Jordan and the stability of Egypt. Those two pillars of America’s Middle East alliance structure both fear that Netanyahu aims to drive Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank into their countries, which would surely foment instability that would spill over their borders even if Palestinians themselves did not. This hurts us in other ways. As Hans Wechsel, a former senior policy adviser to U.S. Central Command, put it to me: “The more hopeless things seem for Palestinian aspirations, the less readiness there will be in the region to expand the U.S.-Arab-Israeli security integration that could have nailed down long-term advantages over Iran and China — and without requiring nearly as many U.S. military resources in the region to sustain.” On the Middle East, you have some good independent instincts, Mr. President. Follow them. Otherwise you need to prepare yourself for this looming reality: Your Jewish grandchildren will be the first generation of Jewish children who will grow up in a world where the Jewish state is a pariah state. I will leave you with the words of the May 7 Haaretz editorial: “On Tuesday, the Israel Air Force killed nine children, between the ages of 3 and 14. …The Israeli military said that the target was a ‘Hamas command and control center’ and that ‘steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming uninvolved civilians.’… We can continue to ignore the number of Palestinians in the Strip who have been killed — more than 52,000, including around 18,000 children; to question the credibility of the figures, to use all of the mechanisms of repression, denial, apathy, distancing, normalization and justification. None of this will change the bitter fact: Israel killed them. Our hands did this. We must not avert our eyes. We must wake up and cry out loudly: Stop the war.”",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,7,1466,0.053,0.416,0.043,0.303,0.113,0.578,0.409,0.455,0.341,0.5,0.4
143,45755,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,"Trump and Netanyahu Steer Toward an Ugly World, Together","There was a time when a meeting between the president of the United States and the prime minister of Israel brought only pride to both Israeli and American Jews, who saw two democratic leaders working together. Well, I know that I am not alone when I say that pride is not the emotion that welled up in me on seeing the chummy picture of Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu meeting in the Oval Office on Monday. It was disgust and depression. Each is a wannabe autocrat, each is working to undermine the rule of law and so-called elites in his respective country, each is seeking to crush what he calls a “deep state” of government professionals. Each is steering his nation away from its once universal aspiration to be a “light unto the nations” toward a narrow, brutish might-equals-right ethnonationalism that is ready to mainstream ethnic cleansing. Each treats his political opposition not as legitimate but as enemies within, and each has filled his cabinet with incompetent hacks, deliberately chosen for loyalty to him instead of the laws of their lands. Each is driving his country away from its democratic traditional allies. Each asserts territorial expansion as a divine right — “From the Gulf of America to Greenland” and “From the West Bank to Gaza.” In 2008, Fareed Zakaria published a prescient book titled “The Post-American World.” He argued that while the United States would continue to be the dominant world power, the “rise of the rest” — nations like China and India — meant that America’s relative dominance would shrink as the Cold War era receded. Trump and Netanyahu are engaged, each in his own country, in creating a “post-America” and a “post-Israel” world. By “post-America,” though, I don’t mean an America that is losing relative power but an America that is deliberately shedding its core identity as a country, on its best days, committed to the rule of law at home and the betterment of all humanity abroad. By “post-Israel,” I mean an Israel that is deliberately shedding its core identity — that of a proudly proclaimed rule-of-law democracy in a region of strongmen that will always prioritize a permanent peace with Palestinians (if its security can be assured) over “a permanent piece’’ of the West Bank and Gaza. One simply cannot imagine Trump or Vice President JD Vance aspiring to build the America that Ronald Reagan described in his Jan. 11, 1989, farewell address. Reagan spoke of the need to reinforce in our children “what America is and what she represents in the long history of the world.” That America was a moral and political beacon, “a tall, proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans, wind-swept, God-blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace; a city with free ports that hummed with commerce and creativity. And if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors, and the doors were open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here.” Instead, Trump and Vance want to transform our nation into a post-Reagan America, an America that treats democratic, free market, rule-of-law allies like the European Union with disdain. Trump recently stated that the European Union was created to “screw the U.S.” — a sentiment he repeated sitting next to Netanyahu in the Oval Office. The sheer malevolence and historical ignorance of that statement takes your breath away. Trump and Vance also want to take us to a post-America that greets courageous defenders of freedom’s frontier — namely Ukraine — with demands for their mineral rights in return for grudging military assistance. Finally, they want to take us to a post-America that is not the least bit interested in preserving, let alone enhancing, its soft power — the power to enlist allies and attract talented immigrants — a concept popularized by the Harvard political scientist Joseph S. Nye Jr. They have contempt for soft power, being utterly ignorant of the fact that if we lose it, we lose our ability to get other nations to join with us to shape a world more receptive to our interests and values, the single greatest advantage we always had over Russia and China. In mindlessly shrinking our own government and dissing so many of our traditional allies, “Trump is not just destroying careers and values, he is quite literally making America weak again,” the Stanford democracy expert Larry Diamond told me. That is about as “post” the America I grew up in — and aspire to see my grandchildren grow up in — as I can imagine. Netanyahu has been hard at work creating a similar post-Israel. Trump forced out his F.B.I. director for being insufficiently loyal; Netanyahu is close to doing the same with Ronen Bar, the widely respected head of Israel’s F.B.I. equivalent, the Shin Bet, at a time when Bar is investigating some of Netanyahu’s top aides over alleged ties to the Qatari government. Netanyahu himself is on trial on corruption charges. He stands accused by the Israeli opposition — and by more than a few relatives of hostages — of prolonging the Gaza war to appease the Jewish supremacists who keep him in power and potentially out of jail. That prolongation also forestalls any commission of inquiry for the disastrous war, which started on his watch and for reasons directly traceable to his policy failure: his belief that Hamas could be bought off with bags of money from Qatar. He is also trying, as we speak, to remove Israel’s independent and courageous attorney general because he apparently considers her disloyal. Since coming to office in late 2022, Netanyahu has also been on a mission to undermine the power of the Israeli Supreme Court to check the decisions of the executive and legislative branches. This is related to his party’s religious-nationalist agenda to annex the West Bank and Gaza and evict as many Palestinians as possible — a goal feasible only if that court’s power to restrain the prime minister and his Jewish supremacist coalition is broken. Netanyahu’s aim today is “dismantling all the essential components of democracy,” wrote Mickey Gitzin, director of the New Israel Fund, in Haaretz on Sunday. “The method is a simple one: You create a maelstrom of daring, illegal moves, simultaneously and on all fronts. While the public is reacting to the dismissal of the head of the Shin Bet security service, you advance draconian legislation against” nongovernmental organizations. “When everyone is preoccupied with the status of legal advisers, you advance bills that will make it easier to disqualify Arab candidates.” The public and the opposition get so overwhelmed they find it hard “to process the deluge,” he added, and resistance slowly fragments. Sound familiar? Trump’s and Netanyahu’s domestic strategies have truly merged with the weaponization of antisemitism as a way to silence or delegitimize critics. Readers of this column know that I have zero respect for any campus protesters who bash Israeli actions in Gaza without uttering a word of censure for Hamas — let alone a word of support for Ukrainians whose democracy is being savaged by Vladimir Putin’s Russia. But ours is, for now, still a free country, and if people aren’t engaging in violent acts, or harassing other students in or out of class, they should be free to say whatever they want, including advocating a Palestinian state of whatever size they want. “President Trump has taken a real phenomenon that needs to be addressed — antisemitism that emerges out of debates on Israel — and is using it to justify crackdowns on immigration, higher education and free speech on Israel,” Jonathan Jacoby, national director of the Nexus Project, which works to fight antisemitism and uphold democracy, said to me. As an American Jew, I neither need nor want Trump’s cynical defense. He is still the man who, in 2017, defended the white nationalists and neo-Nazis who protested in Charlottesville, Va., as including “some very fine people.” Vance has also embraced Germany’s Nazi-sympathizing, Holocaust-trivializing AfD party, whose leaders have called on Germans to stop atoning for Nazi crimes. As Rabbi Sharon Brous of the Los Angeles congregation IKAR eloquently warned in a March 8 sermon: “We, the Jews, are being used to advance a political agenda that will cause grave harm to the social fabric, and to the institutions that are best suited to protect Jews and all minorities. We are being used. Our pain, our trauma, is being exploited to eviscerate the dream of a multiracial democracy, while advancing the goal of a white Christian nation.” Netanyahu — like Trump and thanks to Trump — feels a sense of impunity, a sense that nothing can take him down. That kind of thinking filters down and is what leads to incidents like the one last month in which Israeli forces killed 15 paramedics and rescue workers in southern Gaza, an incident that “the chain of command below simply lied” about, a senior Israel Defense Forces officer told Haaretz. Fortunately, Israeli civil society has shown a lot of fight — much more than America’s so far — and no wonder. Because while Trump can denounce America’s elites to the cheers of his base, Israelis know their country cannot survive without its technical, scientific and military elites. Which is why this month, 18 former Israeli security chiefs — of the I.D.F., Mossad, Shin Bet, military intelligence and police — declared that Netanyahu was unfit to serve as prime minister, because his “conduct poses a clear and immediate danger to Israel’s security and future as a Jewish democratic state.” To all who aspire to prevent a post-America, post-Israel world, I have only one message: This is the fight of our lives.

144,45699,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,What’s Most Frightening About Trump’s Gaza Ravings,"President Trump’s plan to take over Gaza, remove its two million Palestinians and turn the coastal desert strip into some sort of Club Med proves only one thing: how short a distance it is between out-of-the-box thinking and out-of-your-mind thinking. I can say with confidence that Trump’s proposal is the single most idiotic and dangerous Middle East “peace” initiative ever put out by an American president. Still, I’m not sure what is more frightening: Trump’s Gaza proposal, which seems to change by the day, or the speed with which his aides and cabinet members — almost none of whom were even briefed on it in advance — nodded their approval of the idea like a collection of bobblehead dolls. Pay attention, ladies and gentlemen: This is not just about the Middle East. This is also a microcosm of the problem we now face as a country. In his first term, Trump was surrounded by buffers: aides, cabinet secretaries and generals who deflected and restrained his worst impulses many times. Now Trump is surrounded only by amplifiers: aides, cabinet secretaries, senators and House members who live in fear of his wrath or of being set upon by online mobs unleashed by his enforcer, Elon Musk, should they step out of line. This combination of Trump unleashed, Musk unrestrained and much of the government and the business establishment living in fear of being tweeted about by either man is a recipe for chaos at home and abroad. Trump is operating more like the Godfather than the president: “Nice little territory you have there (Greenland, Panama, Gaza, Jordan, Egypt) — be a shame if anything bad happened to it …” That may work in the movies, but in real life, if the Trump administration actually tries to force Jordan and Egypt or any other Arab state to accept the Palestinians living in Gaza — and have the Israeli Army round them up and deliver them, since Trump has said the transfer would not involve U.S. troops and not cost American taxpayers a dime — it will destabilize the demographic balance in Jordan between East Bankers and Palestinians, destabilize Egypt and destabilize Israel. As much as Israelis hate Hamas, I am confident that many soldiers, outside of those on the far right, will refuse to be part of any operation that could be compared to the rounding up and transferring of Jews from their homes during World War II. As Israel’s Haaretz newspaper opined: “There are no magical solutions that can simply dissolve the conflict. The audacity of presenting such a solution — one that echoes terms like ‘transfer,’ ‘ethnic cleansing’ and other war crimes — is an insult to both Palestinians and Israelis.” Trump will also create a backlash against American Embassies and interests across the Arab Muslim world, with many Muslims taking to the streets in Europe, the Middle East and Asia to resist Palestinians being forced from their land in the name of Trump creating a beach resort in the Gaza Strip that he said “I would own” and Palestinians would have no right to return to. It would be the single greatest gift Trump could give to Iran to make a comeback in the Middle East by embarrassing all the pro-American Sunni regimes. U.S. companies like McDonald’s and Starbucks, which have already faced boycotts as a result of America arming Israel in the Gaza war, would get hammered even harder. Does Trump have any point? Well, yes. He is right that Hamas is a sick, twisted organization, whose slaughter of some 1,200 people on Oct. 7, 2023, and kidnapping of some 250 more triggered the merciless Israeli attack on Hamas, hiding underground in Gaza, without regard to Gazan civilians. Hamas used its Palestinian neighbors as human sacrifices, with the goal of delegitimizing Israel across the globe. For many young people who get their news only from TikTok videos, it worked, though it could not have been a more cynical strategy. Trump is also right that Gaza is now a hellhole as a result. And Trump is right that the Palestinian refugee problem has been kept alive way too long by cynics in the Arab world and Israel and incompetent Palestinian leaders. Coming back from Oct. 7 to any kind of peace process will not be easy, but the notion that everything has been tried and the only option left is ethnic cleansing is wrong — but that is what the Israeli right and Hamas want everyone to believe. One of the biggest problems with this Trump team is that its whole view of the Middle East is filtered through the lens of the Israeli far right and evangelical Christians. To the extent that the Trump people know the Arab world, it is through the Persian Gulf investment community. So they are complete and total suckers for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. For instance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio keeps telling Arab leaders, “Hamas can never govern Gaza or threaten Israel again.” But he seems to be clueless that it was Netanyahu who arranged for Qatar to give Hamas hundreds of millions of dollars that it diverted to its tunnel-building and arms-manufacturing program so it could rule Gaza forever. Bibi wanted Hamas to “govern Gaza” and not the West Bank Palestinian Authority so that the Palestinians would always be divided and never able to be a partner for a two-state solution — the goal of every U.S. president since George H.W. Bush. And the reason Netanyahu has refused to define an alternative leadership for Gaza is that he knows the only credible alternative is a reformed Palestinian Authority but the far right in Israel would topple him if he agreed to such a solution. So please, spare me the idea that everything else but ethnic cleansing has been tried in good faith by both sides. If Trump really wants to make a radical departure and take advantage of some of the fear he instills in people, it is not with this juvenile Mar-a-Gaza proposal. It would be to publicly call out all the parties and challenge each of them to actually, in good faith, do the hard stuff required to dig out of this hellhole. It would be to tell the Palestinian Authority that if it wants to govern Gaza, it needs to appoint a new, noncorrupt leader and a new, effective prime minister — someone like former Prime Minister Salam Fayyad — immediately. This reformed Palestinian Authority then needs to create a technocratic cabinet to invite an Arab peacekeeping force to take over Gaza from Israel, finish the eviction of the Hamas leadership and solicit the international assistance needed to rebuild Gaza. That Arab force would also have to commit to training up a Palestinian Authority security force so that it could eventually govern Gaza on its own, with Arab help. And it would be to tell Netanyahu that as soon as the Arab peacekeeping force is up and running, Gaza will be divided into Area A and Area B. The Palestinian Authority and the Arab peacekeeping force will govern Area A — all the population centers — and the Israeli Army can stay on the whole perimeter — Area B — for several years. After that, Palestinians will hold elections in the West Bank and Gaza and negotiate a two-state solution with Israel for both territories. Once that process is underway, Saudi Arabia can normalize relations with Israel, and the U.S.-Saudi security treaty can go ahead. Trump can learn this early, or he can learn this late: America’s interests and Netanyahu’s interests are not aligned. Bibi’s interest is to use any means to stay in power, no matter if it means delaying hostage releases, fighting a forever war or abandoning the prospect of a historic normalization of relations between the Jewish state and Saudi Arabia. Netanyahu even said the other day that “the Saudis can create a Palestinian state in Saudi Arabia; they have a lot of land over there,” triggering a harsh Saudi response. Will Trump ever wake up and realize how much Netanyahu and the Jewish supremacists in Israel see him as their chump? Virtually the entire security establishment in Israel has been up in arms over the fact that Netanyahu has refused to ever identify a plan to translate Israel’s military victory in Gaza into a sustainable political one. So here is what Bibi told the Knesset this week: “Trump’s vision is new, creative, revolutionary, and he is determined to implement it. You talked about ‘the day after’ [plan for Gaza] — so you got your ‘day after’! Only it doesn’t match the Oslo vision. Because we will not repeat this mistake again.” Bibi is just using Trump to buy more time on a road to nowhere. If Bibi gets where he is going, every young Jew today will learn what it is to grow up in a world where the Jewish state is a pariah state. President Trump, I repeat: There is a real case for you to make for fresh thinking about this problem. But your plan for Trump Gaza is not fresh thinking. It is fresh riffing. It is loopy concepts of a peace plan tossed out without vetting by aides or allies, the details of which you change every day, forcing your bobblehead aides to nod vigorously — without any regard for long-term U.S. interests or their own credibility. It is a plan that will love Israel to death, bring Iran back to life and destabilize every American friend.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,7,1588,0.125,0.086,0.076,0.09,0.257,0.062,0.199,0.109,0.147,0.5,0.107
145,45678,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,"President Trump, You Can Remake the Middle East if You Dare","Dear President Trump: You may not be interested in Jewish or Arab history, but they are both very interested in you today. This is one of those rare moments — like after World War I, World War II and the Cold War — when everything in the Middle East is in play and everything is possible. And right now, everyone is waiting for you. No exaggeration: You have a chance to reshape this region in ways that could fundamentally enhance the peace and prosperity of Israelis, Palestinians and all the region’s people, as well as the national security interests of America. Be advised, though, while the wages of success will be enormous, the consequences of failure will be utterly hellish. It’s the Nobel Prize or the booby prize. Yet there is no escaping this mission. The Middle East is either going to be reborn as a strong region where normalized relations, trade and cooperation are defining objectives or disintegrate into a few solid nation-states surrounded by vast zones of disorder, warlordism and terrorists who are chillingly expert at using drones. On every train schedule there is something known as the last train. Well, when it comes to peacemaking between Israelis and Palestinians, before Israeli West Bank settlements totally choke off any possibility of a two-state deal; to ending Lebanon’s 50-year civil war, while there is still a shred of hope; to giving Syria a chance to reintegrate after 14 years of strife; and to neutralizing Iran before it gets a nuclear bomb, this really feels like a last train. On Sunday, for the first time since Oct. 7, 2023, one could see a scintilla of hope that this war could wind down, as Israelis embraced loved ones who had been hostages for more than a year and Gazans left shelters and returned to their homes — where they are still standing. Haaretz quoted Ahmed Mattar in Gaza City, one of many displaced Palestinians walking north with belongings on carts and donkeys, as saying something that I am sure spoke for most Israelis and Palestinians (and certainly did for me): “People just want this madness to stop.” No one will have a bigger say in that than you, President Trump. So let’s survey the challenge. I’m confident you now understand from your recent involvement with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — pressing him to accept the cease-fire and hostage-prisoner exchange that Biden set up and Bibi had consistently opposed — that your political and diplomatic aspirations are in fundamental contradiction to his. Your aspirations and America’s interests, in fact, are the fuse that would probably blow up Bibi’s cabinet and potentially end his political career. An aging Joe Biden, whom Bibi could outfox, was his dream. You are his nightmare. Monday’s headline in Haaretz — “Netanyahu Is Lying to Trump and Preparing to Sabotage the Gaza Cease-Fire Deal” — did not come out of thin air. Your interest is to bring Israel and Saudi Arabia into a U.S.-led alliance with our other Arab partners, and that will require Israel to open talks on a two-state solution with the Palestinian Authority. Netanyahu’s political survival — what will keep his coalition in power and forestall any national inquiry commission over who was at fault for the Hamas surprise attack on his watch — depends on the Gaza war resuming after this cease-fire and Bibi never opening time-bound negotiations with the Palestinian Authority on two states for two peoples. That is why, in response to the vicious Hamas onslaught in 2023, Netanyahu launched a war to root out Hamas from Gaza, but it had two contradictory goals — plus no stated vision for peace with Palestinians after it ended. Netanyahu’s goals were “total victory” over Hamas and a return of the hostages. But total military victory over Hamas, even if it were possible, would have surely meant the deaths of most if not all the hostages. Unfortunately and remarkably, the Jewish supremacists in Netanyahu’s cabinet, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, forced Netanyahu to pursue a war to destroy much of Gaza, even at the cost of Israel being accused of war crimes, in hopes this would lead to total displacement of Palestinians and the Israeli annexation of part of Gaza — the hostages be damned. Bibi went along with Ben-Gvir and Smotrich, until you forced him to choose. Yes, Hamas is an Islamo-fascist organization that has been a curse on the Palestinian people. But as a movement, it can be eliminated only by other, more moderate Palestinians. Netanyahu never wanted or tried to help build an alternative to Hamas in the form of an upgraded and reformed West Bank Palestinian Authority. He just kept sending his army in and out of Gaza, triggering exactly what this column predicted: a permanent insurgency just like what we triggered in Iraq before we moved to the strategy of clear, hold and build a decent alternative. Have you seen how many Israeli soldiers have been killed lately in Gaza by Iraqi-style I.E.D.s made out of unexploded Israeli ordnance? Here is how then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken put it last week in his eloquent farewell to Middle East diplomacy: “Each time Israel completes its military operations and pulls back, Hamas militants regroup and re-emerge because there’s nothing else to fill the void. Indeed, we assess that Hamas has recruited almost as many new militants as it has lost. That is a recipe for an enduring insurgency and perpetual war.” U.S. policy must be to ensure that all three stages of this cease-fire agreement are carried out and followed by a real diplomatic process for a wider settlement. I agree with the argument of the Israeli strategist Gidi Grinstein that only a reformed and upgraded Palestinian Authority can replace Hamas in Gaza, but it needs the support of an international or Arab force, invited in by the P.A. to help with security and reconstruction. Then Gaza, like the West Bank under the Oslo agreement, should be divided into Areas A and B for a four-year transition period. Eighty percent would be Area A (under the international force/Palestinian control), and 20 percent (basically the perimeter) would remain under Israeli military control until Israel’s security is assured. After the four-year transition, the two sides would agree on a permanent status in tandem with the West Bank, where, hopefully by then, the Palestinian Authority would be led by an incorruptible institution builder, like former Prime Minister Salam Fayyad. This approach would lock in the U.S.-Saudi-Israeli-Palestinian security deal. Meanwhile, in Lebanon we have an enormous opportunity to truly end the civil war there and put the country back together. The new president, Joseph Aoun, and his newly named prime minister, Nawaf Salam, are widely respected, moderate, Lebanese patriots — which is why so many Lebanese took to the streets to celebrate their taking office. The most important thing U.S. diplomats should do, besides offer Lebanon economic aid to recover and military aid to strengthen its army, is to finally draw a mutually agreed-on, U.N.-recognized border between Lebanon and Israel. Why? Because for decades Hezbollah justified holding arms by claiming it was necessary for recovering Israeli-occupied parts of southern Lebanon. The whole thing was bogus, involving a few disputed meters and half-kilometer sections along the border. It is critical for the U.S. and Israel to take that oxygen of a border dispute away from Hezbollah. But we also need to make clear to the Shiites of Lebanon that America wants them — and will help make them — equal citizens of the Lebanese state, without their having to rely on an armed Hezbollah. After speaking to a senior Israeli official the other day, I am convinced that Bibi understands that and that by significantly weakening Hezbollah and Iran, he has helped set in motion the possibility for Lebanon and Syria to restore their sovereignty and unity. I think he is ready to complete Israel’s withdrawal and finalize the border — provided the Lebanese government produces the military force to ensure that Hezbollah cannot embed itself in southern Lebanon again. (Side note, Mr. President: You really should retain Amos Hochstein, Biden’s special Lebanon negotiator, to handle this job. He is widely respected there, even by Hezbollah.) A stable, pluralistic Lebanon is the best steppingstone for fixing Syria. In Syria, we need to forge a kind of contact group among the U.S., Turkey, Jordan, Iraq and Israel as an engine for helping solidify a coalition government there that balances the Islamists — whose fighters toppled the murderous regime of Bashar al-Assad — and the secular, multiconfessional Syrian majority. This is not going to be easy, but we have to try. I believe the new de facto Syrian leader, Ahmad al-Shara, has the potential to be a decent, unifying national leader for the country, but we have to be in there with both hands encouraging and enticing and pressuring him to do the right things — even if we fail. The worst thing you could do is wash your hands of Syria at this key time or just turn it over to Turkey. Finally, on Iran, Israel has done the world a huge favor in stripping this awful, corrupt, repressive regime of much of its ability to project power around the region through failing states and proxy militias in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen while hiding behind Tehran’s nuclear program. That nuclear program and Iran’s malign regional strategy need to be eliminated. I hope you can do it through peaceful negotiations; otherwise, it needs to be done kinetically. The more credibly we threaten the second, the more likely we will get the first. Good luck, Mr. Trump.

146,45639,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,The First New Foreign Policy Challenge for Trump Just Became Clear,"I have a simple rule of thumb when assessing the potential instability of Middle Eastern countries. They come in just two varieties: countries that implode and countries that explode. That is, countries where, when central control collapses, the ruined pillars fall inside their borders, and countries where, when central control collapses, the blast radius of all the political shrapnel extends far and wide. There is no country in the Middle East that explodes more than Syria. Whatever happens in Syria will not stay in Syria. That is because Syria is both a keystone and a microcosm of the whole Middle East. As a keystone, once it crumbles, the effects radiate out in all directions. As a microcosm — Syria has Sunnis, Shiites, Alawites, Kurds, Christians and Druse — whenever central control is loosened, it is a source of insecurity for every sect, so they often reach outside for help. It is also a source of opportunity for every regional power, so they often reach inside to tilt Syria their way. Historically, it took an iron-fisted leader in Damascus to keep Syria under control on the inside and deter regional powers who wanted to control it from the outside. But because of Syria’s centrality, positive change there could also radiate out in all directions. And that brings me to the purpose of this column. Memo to the secretary of state-designate, Marco Rubio: You may not realize it yet, but if confirmed, your first big challenge as President Donald Trump’s top diplomat may be to persuade him to abandon all of the isolationist-America-First-not-sure-we-want-to-stay-in-NATO-who-needs-allies-who-cares-about-“shithole”-countries rhetoric that Trump is known for, so you can help with — dare I say it — nation-building in Syria. Because the toppling of President Bashar al-Assad by Syrian rebels is one of the biggest, potentially most positive, game-changing events in the Middle East in the last 45 years. The thing about opportunities in foreign policy, though, is they can come totally out of the blue — and the great presidents are the ones who seize them, even if it means eating a little crow. In fairness to Trump, when the opportunity for the Abraham Accords manifested itself in 2020, also out of the blue, he seized it and helped to forge normalization between Israel and four Arab states — to the benefit of the region and to the United States. This is a similar moment. The odds of success are low, the payoff could be enormous and the risks to America not all that high, but it will require a lot more intensive U.S. leadership than the Abraham Accords. To understand why, I need to take you back to 2003. The U.S. invasion of Iraq under President George W. Bush always had two objectives. One was removing weapons of mass destruction, which turned out to be fraudulent. The other, which I supported, was aspirational but ultimately impossible: trying to replace Saddam Hussein with a multisectarian, pluralistic democracy in a great Arab capital — Baghdad — in the hope that this could create an example in the heart of the Arab world that could radiate out and help cure the pathologies that produced the Sept. 11 attacks. I say “impossible” because, as we learned, you can’t deliver democracy from the top down and from the outside in. It has to grow organically from the bottom up. In Iraq, it was primarily U.S. forces who pulled down Hussein’s statue in Baghdad, not Iraqis, even if many of them enjoyed watching it crumble. In the end, Iraqis did produce a constitutional power-sharing democracy on their own, but it teeters on the edge of failed statehood and is deeply penetrated by Iranian agents and influence, as well as homegrown corruption. While Iraq has actually held six pretty fair elections since the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Hussein in 2003, the multiparty parliament it produced is dominated by parties defined by sect or ethnicity, not a true spirit of Iraqi citizenship strong and broad enough to resist Iran. Iraq has also struggled since 2003 because the tyrants running neighboring Syria and Iran — al-Assad and Ali Khamenei — did everything they could to make sure no decent democratic example would emerge in Baghdad that might inspire their own people to follow suit. Eventually, though, the Arab Spring that began in Tunisia and Egypt spread to Syria in 2011 — organically, without a U.S. invasion — but al-Assad was ready to kill hundreds of thousands of his own people and drive millions abroad to hold onto power — until last week. The big question in my mind now is: Will the Middle East get another chance to have a consensual, pluralistic government emerge in its midst in another great Arab capital, Damascus — only this time driven by its own people, not by any foreign power? If Syrians over the coming years can find their way from the bottom up to live together in a pluralistic society as citizens, not just sects, held together by voluntary consent, not just the iron fist of a dictator, that would radiate out to Iraq, Lebanon, Iran, Libya, Sudan — everywhere. That would be the most positive event in the Middle East since Anwar Sadat got on a plane and went to Israel to make peace in 1977 — and one of the most important in modern Arab politics. I don’t need any lectures on how unlikely this is. I lived through the Lebanese civil war for over four years and reported extensively from Iraq. A happy ending in Syria is a low-probability outcome, but it offers an enormous payoff for the Syrian people and the whole region. And unlike the U.S. invasion of Iraq, it would cost the United States and its allies little money and few troops to try to help. But it will not happen without American help and leadership and some consistent and tough-minded diplomacy, ready to risk failure and ready to understand that benign neglect could be hugely costly to our allies. Competition within Syria — and over Syria by outsiders — will spill across the whole region. It will be a forever war that will open the way for the re-emergence of ISIS and could easily destabilize the frail democracy in Iraq and the monarchy in Jordan, and suck Israel into Syria — meaning seven million Jews would be controlling all of Gaza and parts of both Lebanon and Syria, as well as Israel and the West Bank. Israel will be completely overstretched and need billions in extra U.S. aid. I don’t know what is in the head or the heart of the Syrian rebel leader, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani. I read that he has spent years trying to remake his image, renouncing his longtime ties to Al Qaeda and presenting himself as a leader promoting pluralism and tolerance. I just know that we should be doing all we can from the outside to encourage, pressure and incentivize al-Jolani to live up to the image. I was impressed by how Secretary of State Antony Blinken jumped right in with this Dec. 10 statement: The United States reaffirms its full support for a Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political transition. This transition process should lead to credible, inclusive and nonsectarian governance. … The transition process and new government must also uphold clear commitments to fully respect the rights of minorities, facilitate the flow of humanitarian assistance to all in need, prevent Syria from being used as a base for terrorism or posing a threat to its neighbors. I believe the Syrian problem will be a microcosm of the key challenge the Trump foreign policy team will face globally — how to manage weakness, not strength. How to manage states falling apart and threatening the world by their collapse, not states rising up and threatening the world with their strength. Other than China, it is weak states, not strong states, that will vex America and its allies, and therefore the central challenge for the Trump team will be how to do nation-building or nation-repairing at a cost that the American people will tolerate. As the Haaretz economic writer David Rosenberg pointed out regarding just Syria: “The reconstruction bill will easily be seven times the size of Syria’s entire economy, and the work itself will require the kind of technical expertise that only a few countries can provide. … The problem is that Syria is broke, and Trump is unlikely to provide it with significant aid money. It’s also under Western sanctions that Trump would have to lift. … For Syria to recover and rebuild, the stars will have to align perfectly in a constellation of good leadership, national unity and international good will.” Trump could choose to just walk away from Syria, as he tried to do once before, when he was president, and watch the Middle East completely unravel and just say what Vice President-elect JD Vance once said about Ukraine: “I don’t really care what happens.” Or Trump could acknowledge that the only way we can help tilt Syria in a positive direction at a tolerable price is if we build a coalition with our NATO allies, Japan, Korea and Australia — and maybe even China and India — that seeks to give the Syrian uprising the best chance possible to succeed. President Biden walked away from Afghanistan shortly after he took office. It was ugly for him and sad for the Afghans. But Syria is not Afghanistan. Afghanistan implodes.

147,45615,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,How Trump Can Earn a Place in History That He Did Not Expect,"Does Donald Trump’s return to the presidency herald the end of U.S. pressure on Israelis and Palestinians for a two-state solution? Not necessarily: It depends on which Donald Trump occupies the White House. Will it be the Trump who just appointed Mike Huckabee, a supporter of Israeli annexation of the West Bank, as his new ambassador in Jerusalem? Or will it be the Trump who, with his son-in-law Jared Kushner, crafted and released the most detailed plan for a two-state solution since Bill Clinton’s administration? You read that right: Trump was the rare American president who actually put out a detailed plan for coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians. If that Trump revives that initiative in 2025, he could be remembered as the president who preserved Israel as a Jewish democracy and helped to securely birth a Palestinian state alongside it. But if he continues along the path signaled by the Huckabee nomination, he will most likely be remembered as the president who oversaw the end of Israel as a Jewish democracy and buried any hope of a Palestinian state. Either way, Trump may not be interested in Jewish or Palestinian history, but Jewish and Palestinian history will be interested in him. The last time I spoke with Trump, four years ago, he called to thank me for endorsing the Abraham Accords, which paved the way for a historic peace between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco. Say what you will about Trump (and there is a lot to say), but he’s drawn to striking big deals that can have profound and even history-shaping consequences. I’ve just spent a week in Israel and the U.A.E. talking to political, military and business leaders, Jews and Palestinians and Arabs about what Trump might do in their region this time around. There is enormous opportunity and appetite for a game-changing deal — if Trump wants to reach for it and only if he does it right. Trump has a starting point: the plan for a two-state solution that he put out in January 2020, titled “Peace to Prosperity: A Vision to Improve the Lives of the Palestinian and Israeli People.” Neither side will embrace it as it is currently written, and the Hamas attack of Oct. 7, 2023, and the ensuing war in Gaza will complicate any deal enormously. But the “vision” in the title of Trump’s plan is a kick-starter for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations post-Gaza. It’s still the only detailed peace map that any president has publicly presented to create two states since the Clinton parameters, set out by Clinton 24 years ago. The plan offered Israel the right to annex roughly 30 percent of the West Bank where a majority of Jewish settlers reside, with the remainder going for a demilitarized Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza. Trump proposed that Gaza would be expanded with land from Israel’s Negev Desert to compensate Palestinians for part of the territory they would relinquish from the West Bank. It was not a one-to-one land swap, as the Palestinians have demanded — more like one to two. It’s not the plan I would’ve put out, and it involved zero Palestinian input, but it was a starting point. And Trump proposed that Gaza and the West Bank be connected by a combination of aboveground roads and tunnels — but only after Hamas is removed from leadership in Gaza, as he insisted back then. The Palestinian capital would be on the outskirts of Jerusalem. I repeat: Trump’s plan would have to change because of the fallout from Oct. 7. It has zero possibility of being accepted as is from either side. But that is not the point. The point is that it has all the key ingredients to start talks. The plan tells both sides that the only stable solution has to involve two states for two indigenous peoples — with land swaps and mutually agreed-upon security arrangements that they would negotiate. And never forget: Trump’s 2020 plan has some important fingerprints on it. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Ron Dermer, then his ambassador to the U.S. and now his closest adviser, embraced it at the time, but Bibi never formally presented it to his cabinet. Instead, as Trump knows, Netanyahu tried to just annex parts of the territory Trump had designated for Israel, but Trump stopped him. Then the U.A.E. stepped in and said it would normalize relations with Israel if Netanyahu just promised not to unilaterally annex the West Bank. That is how the Abraham Accords came about. But it was only a consolation prize — a valuable one, to be sure — not the deal of the century, to which Trump aspired. So if and when a cease-fire and hostage exchange happens in Gaza, I hope Trump will consider taking advantage of this second chance that history is affording him by inviting both sides to Camp David for a peace summit, with the buy-in to attend being the acceptance of the Trump plan as the floor for negotiations — not the ceiling but the floor — and they can negotiate from there. Is he up to it? I don’t know. I do know that taking the initiative would tell both parties that Trump is not going to wait for their politics to get around to discussing it, because stemming this conflict is a vital U.S. interest before it drags us deeper into a Middle East war than we already are. And we know Trump doesn’t like Middle East wars. It would also signal that Trump is the one setting and driving policy, not the right-wing, pro-Israeli-settlement partisans he has appointed so far to Middle East positions. Because if they — not the Trump peace plan — reflect where the coming Trump administration intends to proceed, good luck even holding the Abraham Accords together, let alone expanding them to Saudi Arabia. Trump will isolate America in the Middle East and in the world. And it will fill his days. Have no illusions: The far-right Christians and Jews who want to annex the West Bank and Gaza will love Israel to death — by asking about seven million Jews to control some seven million Arabs in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza forever. President Biden is a good man who stuck his neck out to arm and diplomatically support Israel after Hamas launched its murderous attack on Oct. 7, backed up by Iran and its proxies. But Biden made a big mistake in terms of U.S. interests. He never put out to the world the comprehensive peace plan he was working on behind the scenes, in which the U.S. would provide security guarantees for Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia would open diplomatic relations with Israel and Netanyahu’s government would negotiate with the Palestinian Authority, which has embraced the Oslo Accords, on a two-state solution. Biden let Netanyahu just string him along, keeping such a deal out of public view, because Bibi knew he would either have to accept it — and have Israel’s ruling coalition brought down by the fanatical Jewish supremacists in the government — or publicly snub Biden and his plan. As he has done since the start of this war, Netanyahu temporized and prioritized his own political survival over the interests of Israel. But America and the Jewish people in and outside Israel have paid a huge price for Biden’s failing to put any plan out in public. How so? The Gaza war was always going to involve a considerable number of civilian casualties because Hamas deliberately embedded rockets and fighters in homes, mosques and hospitals — no matter how careful Israel was, and Israel was not always so careful. There have been tens of thousands of Gazan deaths since Hamas started this war by attacking Israeli civilians and army posts on Oct. 7. But now, 14 months into this war — without any Israeli or U.S. plan for the morning after and with images of Gaza’s casualties and destruction being broadcast hourly on social media all over the world every day — many young people around the world have turned against Israel and America. Gaza looks to them as though Israel is just killing for killing’s sake. And I can’t imagine what the world reaction will be when the international press is allowed to go into Gaza unescorted by the Israeli army and see the damage close up. In short: Israel has never been stronger militarily since this war started, but it has also never been more globally isolated. We know from polling that the Gaza war hurt Kamala Harris with many young voters in Michigan because she could never adequately explain that the Biden-Harris administration was sending weapons to Israel to defeat Hamas in order to put in place a U.S. plan for two states for two indigenous peoples. No plan, no listeners. No listeners, no voters. If Trump were to revive his plan, it would make clear to the world that Israel does not have a blank check from us to fight forever in Gaza with no credible plan of its own for the morning after. It would signal that Palestinians need to get their negotiating act together and not just complain, and it would signal to Iran that Trump intends to isolate Tehran militarily — and diplomatically — by, as he put it in his plan, helping realize the “Palestinians’ legitimate desire for self-determination” if they make a secure peace with Israel. This past week in Israel, I saw and heard one common denominator among the Israeli Jews, Israeli Arabs and West Bank Palestinians I spoke with: They are all exhausted by this war — and the best on both sides are thinking about leaving. As Hani Alami, a Jerusalem Palestinian telecommunications entrepreneur, remarked to me: “The ones who want to leave, on both sides, are the ones who want to live in peace, and the ones who want to stay are the ones who most want to keep fighting.” Surprise them, President-elect Trump. At a minimum, you will be amazed by how much of a debate you trigger within and between Palestinians and Israelis. At maximum, you might find a place in the history books that you did not expect.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,13,1705,0.36,0.517,0.431,0.421,0.426,0.335,0.508,0.45,0.384,0.5,0.511
148,45582,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,How the Biden Team Plans to Build Peace From Sinwar’s Death,"It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of the death of the Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. It creates the possibility not only of ending the Gaza war, returning Israeli hostages and bringing relief to the people of Gaza. It creates the possibility for the biggest step toward a two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians since Oslo, as well as normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia — which means pretty much the entire Muslim world. It’s that big. But, but, but. The death of Sinwar alone is not the sufficient condition to end this Gaza war and put Israelis and Palestinians on a pathway to a better future. Yes, Sinwar and Hamas always rejected a two-state solution and were committed to the violent destruction of the Jewish state. No one paid a bigger price for that than the Palestinians of Gaza. But while his death was necessary for a next step to be possible, it was never going to be everything. The sufficient condition is that Israel have a leader and a governing coalition ready to step up to the opportunity Sinwar’s death has created. To put it bluntly, can Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel live up to his Churchillian self-image and go along with something that he has previously rejected? That is the participation of a reformed West Bank Palestinian Authority in an international peacekeeping force that would take over Gaza in the place of the Sinwar-led Hamas. For the last month or so, according to my U.S., Arab and Israeli diplomatic sources, Secretary of State Antony Blinken — at the direction of President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris — and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt and Mohammed bin Zayed of the United Arab Emirates have been discussing ideas of what to do on the day after this war ends to rebuild a post-Hamas Gaza, pave the way for Saudi-Israeli normalization, and create the conditions for another attempt by Israel and the Palestinians to negotiate a different future in both Gaza and the West Bank. The broad idea is for the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, to agree to appoint the economist and former P.A. prime minister Salam Fayyad — or someone of his sterling reputation for incorruptibility — as the new Palestinian prime minister to lead a new technocratic cabinet and reform the Palestinian Authority, root out corruption and upgrade its governance and security forces. Such a reformed Palestinian Authority would then formally ask for — and participate in — an international peacekeeping force that would include troops from the U.A.E., Egypt, possibly other Arab states and maybe even European nations. This force would be phased in to replace the Israeli military in Gaza. The Palestinian Authority would then be responsible for rebuilding Gaza with relief funds provided by Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E. and other Arab Gulf states, Europeans and most likely the U.S. A reformed Palestinian Authority, with massive Arab and international funds, would attempt to restore its credibility in Gaza, and the credibility of its core Fatah organization in Palestinian politics — and sideline the remnants of Hamas. The U.S. and Arab diplomats — with quiet assistance of the former British prime minister Tony Blair — have been working on this concept with Israel’s minister of strategic affairs, Ron Dermer, Netanyahu’s closest adviser. It requires Israel, for now, only to quietly permit the involvement of the Palestinian Authority in the rebuilding of Gaza as part of the international force — not to formally embrace it. Netanyahu understands, though, that the Arabs will participate in an Arab/international peacekeeping force to clean up the mess in Gaza only if it is part of a process leading to Palestinian statehood. Mohammed bin Salman, in particular, has made it very clear to everyone that for Saudi Arabia to go ahead with normalization with Israel — after so many Palestinian deaths in Gaza — he needs the war in Gaza to end and any Arab peacekeeping force to be a step that will one day lead to a Palestinian state. The same is true for the U.A.E. and Egypt. M.B.S. needs to show in the wake of the Gaza war that he got something from Israel that no other Arab leader ever got, because he is potentially giving Israel something no Israeli leader ever got: relations with the home of Islam’s two holiest mosques. M.B.S. is also vital to getting President Abbas to appoint a reformer like Fayyad. Abbas respects M.B.S. Let me repeat: A diplomatic initiative to end the war along these lines — and engineer a Saudi-Israel normalization and Arab peacekeeping force — will eventually require Israeli commitment to a pathway to Palestinian statehood. That will trigger virulent opposition from Netanyahu’s extremist messianic right-wing partners, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. They will foolhardily see the killing of Sinwar and the collapse of Hamas as an opportunity to think they can kill every last Hamas member in Gaza in order to carry out their agenda of putting Jewish settlements into Gaza and expanding them in the West Bank. Netanyahu has long wanted to show that he is a historic figure, not just a tactician always maneuvering to stay alive politically — but never ready to take a big risk to change history. Well, this is his moment. Will he cross the Rubicon or do what he usually does — just dog paddle in the middle of it and tell those on each side that he is coming their way? But this is also history time for M.B.S. If he wants a security treaty with the U.S., then the process needs to be launched while Biden is still president. (Senate Democrats will never vote for it under Donald Trump.) That means M.B.S. is going to have to normalize relations with Israel before a Palestinian state is actually created — but do it on the basis of both Israelis and Palestinians specifically moving in that direction. As someone who has covered the turmoil in the Middle East intensely since Oct. 7, 2023, I am newly hopeful about the possibility that the killing of Gazan Palestinians will stop, the hostages will be returned and real diplomacy will start. And if the respective leaders rise to this moment, there could be a lot more to be hopeful about. Today is a start. What happens on the day after this war is everything.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,11,1072,0.52,0.693,0.852,0.375,0.5,0.259,0.689,0.549,0.329,0.5,0.1
149,45580,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,It’s Time for America to Get Real With Iran and Israel,"Let’s review the latest headlines: The United States is sending an advanced antimissile system to Israel, along with U.S. troops to operate it. Iran’s foreign minister says there will be “no red lines” governing Iran’s retaliation for any Israeli retaliation for Iran’s latest missile retaliation. And reports from the Persian Gulf say Iran has quietly told Arab gulf states that if Iran is hit by Israel, Tehran may respond by striking Arab oil fields. If all of this does not terrify you, you are not paying attention. May I make a suggestion? How about sending our savvy C.I.A. director, Bill Burns, to meet his Iranian counterpart on neutral turf in Muscat, Oman, with a real strategy for coercive diplomacy vis-à-vis Iran that might actually work to change the Tehran regime’s behavior? Burns could say to the Iranian intelligence chief something like the following: “Let me tell you how your country looks from C.I.A. headquarters: You are infiltrated, exposed and isolated. “Infiltrated? We heard that the latest joke going around Tehran is that your supreme leader is in hiding and the only ones who know where he is are the Israelis. Israel’s intelligence is very good, but the only reason it could have penetrated your leadership and Hezbollah’s so deeply is that so many Iranian and Lebanese Shiites hate both regimes and are ready to spy for Israel. So, you have no idea today when you talk to one another or to Hezbollah whether the person you’re talking to is working for Israel or you. “Exposed? You, Iran, have fired nearly 500 rockets at Israel since April and did not destroy a single military target or kill a single Israeli soldier. I don’t have to tell you that on April 19, an Israeli airstrike on Iran damaged an S-300 air defense system at the Eighth Shekari Air Base in Isfahan. It was reported that Israel had deployed aerial drones and fired at least one missile from a warplane with stealth technology — and you never saw them coming. You are N-A-K-E-D. “And finally, you are isolated. Israel has badly damaged your Hezbollah militia, in which you have invested billions of dollars, so it is no longer your protection against an Israeli strike on your nuclear facilities. We have inflicted heavy damage on your Houthi militia in Yemen. Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad is fed up with you and wants you out of his country, and the Arab gulf states are now doing all they can to woo Assad away from Iran. The mainstream Iraqi Shiite party led by Muqtada al-Sadr hates you for the way your regime and militias have stolen so much oil revenue from Iraq and dragged your Iraqi proxies into your fight with Israel. Polls show how unpopular your regime is across the Arab world. Even Vladimir Putin does not want to see you get a nuclear bomb. A nuclear-armed Iran to his south? He’s not that crazy. “So this is a moment of truth for Iran. You have two paths: Either change your behavior or risk collapsing under the weight of your own recklessness. But when I say change your behavior, this time I mean something different from when we negotiated the nuclear agreement with you during the Obama administration. “We made a mistake back then. We were obsessed with curbing the weapon you were never likely to use — a nuclear bomb, if you could even make one — while ignoring the weapon you were using every day to undermine our interests, the interests of our Arab allies, indeed the interests of most citizens in the region craving stability, not to mention Israel. And that was your implantation of militias armed with increasingly more precise and longer-and-longer-range rockets in Lebanon, Gaza, Syria, Yemen and Iraq. Your proxies crippled those states from the inside and threatened Israel and our Arab allies on the outside. “We are not playing that game anymore. If you continue using your regional militias to attack Israel and you get into a no-holds-barred missile shootout with Tel Aviv, we are going to protect the Israelis, and you are going to get absolutely hammered. And if you carry out your threat to attack Saudi or U.A.E. oil fields to deter us, or close the Strait of Hormuz, your oil industry will be crushed. And your people will not forgive you. No wonder our intel tells us that you are panicked about an Israeli strike. “So, here is what we propose: an end to Iranian imperialism in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Gaza in return for our commitment not to bring down your regime, but instead engage with you on building a regionwide collective security arrangement. You pull back, we pull back and Israel pulls back. But this nonsense of you nurturing failed states in Lebanon, Yemen, Syria and Iraq so that their people can all fight and die while you cheer safely from Tehran — that stops now. “We are not out to humiliate you. You can call it a win for your regime that the Great Satan has recognized Iran as a necessary part of any regional collective security system. But the arming of Hezbollah, the Houthis and the Shiite militias in Iraq is over. You stop that, and we will get the Israelis to withdraw from southern Lebanon and Gaza. The Lebanese Army and a credible, lethal, international force will replace Hezbollah, and an Arab peacekeeping force will replace Hamas. We will also encourage Israel to limit any retaliatory strike against you. “Otherwise, you are on your own.” My point is that if we want a peaceful and better Middle East, we need to sharpen the choices for Iran’s clerical leadership: restart nuclear talks, end the supplying of thousands of rockets to its proxies and be able to stay in power — or we will give Israel every weapon in our conventional arsenal, including the 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs designed to destroy their deeply buried nuclear facilities and the B-2 bombers to deliver them. As Karim Sadjadpour, Iran expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, put it to me: The supreme leader Ali Khamenei “has long believed that continued enmity with America and Israel is more vital to the survival of his regime than rapprochement or reform. For that dynamic to possibly shift, Khamenei must face a profound sense of existential angst, one that convinces him that the current trajectory risks the very collapse of his regime.” Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., the former U.S. Central Command chief, who oversaw the 2020 killing of Qassim Suleimani, the leader of the elite Quds Force within the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, agrees: “Iran may seem unpredictable at times,"" he said in The Atlantic, “but it respects American strength and responds to deterrence. When we withdraw, Iran advances. When we assert ourselves — having weighed the risks and prepared for all possibilities — Iran retreats.” That is why we need to confront Iran with an overwhelming, credible threat of force, coupled with a diplomatic survival pathway out, but one that this time addresses both Iran’s nuclear threat and regional behavior. Our job is to change Iran’s behavior; regime change is the job of the Iranian people. I believe the best way for that regime to lose its grip is to deprive it of the oxygen of permanent conflict with Israel and America — and all the excuses that Iran’s clerical tyrants give for why their people are so isolated and impoverished. But I don’t stop there. We also need to sharpen the choices for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel: We must not be in the business of making Israel safe so that a radical messianic government can annex the West Bank. If we are going to keep resupplying Israel with missiles and even dispatch U.S.-run missile systems, Bibi needs to purge the settler lunatics from his cabinet, forge a national unity coalition and agree to open talks with a reformed Palestinian Authority — with a new technocratic cabinet led by credible leaders like former Prime Minister Salam Fayyad — on a two-state solution. That would pave the way for the U.A.E. and other moderate Arab states to deploy troops to Gaza and for Saudi Arabia to normalize relations with Israel and forge a security agreement with Washington. Let me put this as clearly as I can: This crisis in the Middle East will not end until Israel clearly defines its eastern border and declares that everything beyond it is reserved for a Palestinian state in the West Bank, once Palestinians meet the legitimate security requirements Israel needs to accept a two-state solution. Israel needs to be out of the Jewish settlements business — now. Israel’s creeping West Bank annexation is destroying its legitimacy as a democracy, when its self-defense requires all the friends it can get in the region and beyond. Even more important, though, this crisis in the Middle East will not end until Iran, in effect, defines its western border and declares that everything beyond that is for the Lebanese, Syrians, Yemenis, Iraqis, Israelis and Palestinians to decide — so long as they respect Iran’s legitimate security needs. Iran needs to be out of the Islamic imperialism business. In short, we really need some creative, coercive U.S. diplomacy right now to finally put an end to both Israel’s and Iran’s colonial projects, which feed each other. That is the necessary but not sufficient condition for defusing the madness in this region. Israel cannot afford to be in a long-term, large-scale missile war with Iran. It is too small. Iran is too big and the United States is running low on interceptors to protect Israel — should Iran and all its proxies fire on Israel at once. And Iran cannot afford to be in a large-scale missile war with Israel because the United States and its allies have run out of patience with its reckless adventurism that is destabilizing the whole region.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,11,1658,0.383,0.467,0.089,0.248,0.311,0.517,0.41,0.312,0.296,0.5,0.5
150,45572,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,What I’m Thinking About on the First Anniversary of the War,"So what am I thinking about on this first anniversary of the Hamas-Hezbollah-Iran-Israel war? Something my strategy teacher, Prof. John Arquilla of the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, taught me: All wars come down to two basic questions: Who wins the battle on the ground? And who wins the battle of the story? And what I am thinking about today is how, even after a year of warfare, in which Hamas and Hezbollah and Israel have inflicted terrible pain on one another’s forces and civilians, no one has decisively won the battle on the ground or the battle for the story. Indeed, one year after Oct. 7, this is still the first Arab-Israeli war without a name and without a clear victor — because neither side has a clear win or a clean story. We can and should sympathize with Palestinian statelessness and Arabs in the West Bank living under the duress of Israeli settlements and restrictions, but to my mind, there is nothing that can justify what Hamas attackers did on Oct. 7 — murdering, maiming, kidnapping and sexually abusing any Israeli they could get their hands on, without any goal, any story, other than to destroy the Jewish state. If you believe, as I do, that the only solution is two states for two indigenous peoples between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, the Hamas rampage set that back immeasurably. And what story is Iran telling? That it has some right under the U.N. Charter to help create failed states in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Iraq so it can cultivate proxies inside them for the purpose of destroying Israel? And by what right has Hezbollah dragged Lebanon into a war with Israel that the Lebanese people and government had no say in and are now paying a huge price for? But this Israeli government does not have a clean story in Gaza, either. This was always going to be the ugliest of Israeli-Palestinian wars since 1947, because Hamas had embedded itself in tunnels underneath Gazan homes, schools, mosques and hospitals. It could not be targeted without significant civilian casualties. Therefore, as I argued from the start, it was doubly incumbent on Israel to make clear that this was a war not just to defend itself but also to destroy Hamas in order to birth something better: the only just and stable solution possible, two states for two peoples. The Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu steadfastly has refused to do that, so much so that a year later, it still has not told its people, its army or its U.S. arms supplier what it wants to build in Gaza in place of Hamas other than “total victory.” With Israel still bombing schools to kill a few Hamas fighters hiding inside yet failing to articulate any future for Gazans other than permanent war, it feels as though killing every last Hamasnik is the goal — no matter how many civilians die. That’s a forever war that will undermine both Israel’s and America’s credibility and embarrass Israel’s Arab allies. But the lack of a good story is hurting Israel in other ways. Israelis are being asked to send their sons and daughters to fight every day against Hamas and Hezbollah foes — yet cannot be sure if they are going to war to save the state of Israel or the political career of their prime minister. Because there is more than enough reason to believe that Bibi wants to keep this war going to have an excuse to postpone testifying in December at his corruption trial, to postpone an independent commission of inquiry as to how his government failed to prevent the worst attack on Jews since the Holocaust and to forestall new Israeli elections and maybe even to tilt our presidential election to Donald Trump. Netanyahu’s far-right Jewish supremacist partners have told him they will topple his government if he agrees to stop the war in Gaza before an undefined “total victory” over Hamas and if he tries to bring the West Bank’s Palestinian Authority, which has embraced the Oslo peace process, to help govern Gaza in the place of Hamas — something that Hamas greatly fears. This absence of a story is also hurting Israel strategically. The more Israel has a legitimate Palestinian partner, like a reformed Palestinian Authority, the better chance it can get out of Gaza and not preside over a permanent insurgency there, the more allies will want to help create an international force to fill any vacuum in Southern Lebanon and the more any Israeli military strike against Iran would be understood as making Israel safe to try to make peace with the Palestinians — not safe for an Israeli annexation of the West Bank and Gaza, which is what some of Netanyahu’s far-right partners are seeking. I cannot guarantee that there is a legitimate Palestinian partner for a secure peace with Israel. But I can guarantee that this Israeli government has done everything it could to prevent one from emerging — by strengthening Hamas in Gaza at the expense of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. It is simply insane to me that the United Arab Emirates is telling Israel that it would send military forces to Gaza to stabilize the peace there, in conjunction with the U.S. and other international forces — and that Saudi Arabia has indicated it is ready to normalize relations with Israel, help pay for Gaza’s reconstruction and open a road for relations between the Jewish state and the whole Muslim world — and yet Netanyahu up to now has said no to both because all of this would require that Israel open talks with a reformed Palestinian Authority on a two-state solution and that this Palestinian Authority would formally invite the U.A.E. and others to help secure Gaza. And it is disastrous in another way that is not so obvious. Israel has just delivered a devastating blow to Hezbollah’s leadership. As a purely military operation — combining high tech, intelligence and precision strikes by the Israeli Air Force — it will be studied by armies all over the world. But here’s the rub: I can assure you that most of the Israeli pilots, spies and technologists who produced that operation were the same Israeli street protesters and leaders of the opposition to the judicial coup that Netanyahu attempted in the year before the Hamas invasion — a coup attempt that split the country and encouraged Hamas’s invasion and Hezbollah’s pile-on, as Netanyahu was warned before the war. A few months before Oct. 7, I was invited to do a Zoom meeting with hundreds of Israeli fighter pilots, who were grateful for my opposition to the judicial coup. One asked me straight up whether he should stay in Israel or leave. I told him that I could not answer that, but it was such a reminder to me how much, in war, a country’s story matters. No one has taught me more about the tension between those pilots’ stories and Bibi’s story — and its implications for Israel’s fate — than Dan Ben-David, a Tel Aviv University economist who heads the Shoresh Institution for Socioeconomic Research. I wrote to him to ask what he was thinking about the Oct. 7 anniversary. This is what he emailed back: “My mom was a 13-year-old smuggled alone out of Baghdad to Palestine during World War II. My father landed here as an orphan; his father was butchered by his Lithuanian neighbors as the Nazis moved in. Following the war of independence, my parent’s army units joined to create Kibbutz Malkiya on the Lebanese border. (That kibbutz, where they first met and married, became a charred ghost town over the past year.) That’s my family’s history — but change the names, and you basically have the history of Israel 1.0.” That generation, Ben-David continued, “made sure their children and grandchildren would understand the importance of preserving Israel as our people’s safe haven, built on democracy and the rule of law.” That priority, that story, “was the thread of steel that has bound each generation to our founding one. It creates a situation that makes Israel unique, and not just in comparison with those who want to annihilate us.” Look at how “both Ukraine and Russia have had to pass laws to prevent able-bodied men from leaving during war,” he added. “But when Israel is threatened with war, the planes that are full are not with Israelis trying to escape possible hell but with those dropping everything abroad — school, work, vacations — to come home and defend the country, many of whom eventually lose their lives in doing so. You cannot buy that kind of motivation.” The fact that Israel drafts most 18-year-old men and women “literally provides the army access to the top of the top of Israel’s human spectrum,” noted Ben-David, and it was that cohort that “just devastated Hezbollah’s leadership and intercepted the most massive ballistic missile attack in history.” “That steel thread is what has saved us over the decades — and that is exactly what is so dangerous about Netanyahu’s domestic divide-and-conquer strategy that puts his personal interests above all else. Here we are, after the most horrific period in Israel’s history, and Netanyahu keeps snipping away at the thread,” Ben-David wrote. “Aside from encouraging his cultist followers to make state enemies out of hostage families, pilots, physicians and anyone else who dares to criticize the great leader, he has no exit plan for the deepening military crisis, no budget for the deepening economic crisis, no intention of drafting the ultra-Orthodox into an army desperate for manpower to replace all those who we lost. Because all of those might lead his far-right allies to turn against him.” So on this first anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack, I find myself most preoccupied with the fact that Israel is fighting a multifront war and Israelis still don’t know whether they are fighting to make Israel safe for a Jewish democracy or safe for the prime minister’s political survival, safe for the ultra-Orthodox to never have to serve in the military and safe for the prime minister to declare to the world he is defending the frontier of freedom in Gaza and Lebanon while sustaining a morally rotten and economically draining settlement engine in the West Bank. The biggest threat to Israel today is not Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah or the Houthis. A united Israel can beat them all. It is those who are unraveling Israel’s steel thread — with a bad story.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,11,1765,0.436,0.414,0.151,0.105,0.147,0.228,0.245,0.117,0.123,0.5,0.066
151,45566,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,The First Volleys of a Ballistic Missile War in the Mideast,"Update, 2:15 p.m.: As forecast below, Iran launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles at Israel beginning around 12:30 p.m. Eastern time. The Israeli antimissile system shot down almost all of them, Israeli sources said, and while there was some damage the attack was not considered particularly successful. There are no reports at this time of extensive casualties. The attack was executed by the Air Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and was not an operation of the regular Iranian army or air force, according to Israeli sources. The Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, was not informed of the attack until shortly before it began, the sources said, indicating that the Iranian regime is divided over the operation, which will probably add to the fractures in the government. Israel’s ability to anticipate the Iranian strike and name the precise hour of the attack, and the fact that it was a revolutionary guards operation — not the regular Iranian armed forces under the command of the new president — demonstrates how deeply the Mossad, Israel’s cyber command, Unit 8200, and the Israeli Air Force have penetrated the Iranian regime and coordinated their defensive response. It means no Iranian leader can trust another anymore. We may be about to enter what could be the most dangerous moment in the history of the modern Middle East: a ballistic missile war between Iran and Israel, which would almost certainly bring in the United States on Israel’s side and could culminate in a full-blown U.S.-Israeli effort to destroy Iran’s nuclear program. That is the assessment I have gleaned from talking to Israeli intelligence sources, whose analysis is that Iran plans to launch a missile attack against Israel at 12:30 p.m. Eastern time, which is 7:30 p.m. in Israel. The attack is planned in two waves 15 minutes apart, and each wave will involve 110 ballistic missiles, the Israelis said. The Iranian missiles are aimed at three targets. First, the headquarters of the Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence service, near Tel Aviv. Second, the Israeli air base at Nevatim, and third, the Israeli air base at Khatzirim; both bases are in the south of Israel in the Negev Desert. The Israeli officials are particularly concerned about any strike on Mossad headquarters because it is in the densely populated north Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Hasharon. It is also not far from the Israeli defense intelligence headquarters, Unit 8200. This information has been shared with me because the Israelis insist that they do not want a full-scale ballistic war with Iran, and want the United States to try to deter the Iranians by letting them know that if they do launch this missile attack, the United States will not be a bystander, and its response, unlike with the April 13 Iranian missile and drone attack on Israel, will not be purely defensive. In other words, Iran could be risking its entire nuclear program if this missile attack goes ahead. I have not been able to speak to any senior U.S. officials to gauge their reactions, but will update this blog post as I do. One might think that Israel is itching for this kind of war with Iran to finally take out its nuclear program and involve the United States. That is not my impression. A war of ballistic missiles could do enormous damage to Israel’s infrastructure unless virtually every missile is intercepted. Could the Iranians be bluffing and intending to land the missiles in open areas in Israel? That is not the impression the Israelis have gleaned from their intelligence. The Israeli intelligence assessment is that the Iranian people by and large do not want this war with Israel. There has long been discontent in Iran over the billions of dollars the regime has spent supporting Hamas and Hezbollah at a time when Iranian infrastructure is so dilapidated and the country’s economy is on its back. The message the Israelis hope the U.S. can convey to Iran is also that if they start this war and it leads to great destruction and death of Iranian civilians, it could also trigger an uprising against the regime. In the last year we have seen red lines crossed left and right — from the savage Hamas onslaught on Israel on Oct. 7 to the Israeli pager attack against Hezbollah’s leadership and the assassination of its leader, Hassan Nasrallah. The Iranians feel their deterrence has been eroded and need to respond. This is Code Red time. Because once you start crossing red lines, they all disappear.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,11,752,0.446,0.23,0.078,0.5,0.5,0.055,0.418,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5
152,45564,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,What This Israel-Hezbollah-Hamas-Iran Conflict Is Really About,"To understand why and how Israel’s devastating blow to Hezbollah is such a world-shaking threat to Iran, Russia, North Korea and even China, you have to put it in the context of the wider struggle that has replaced the Cold War as the framework of international relations today. After the Hamas invasion of Israel on Oct. 7, I argued that we were no longer in the Cold War, or the post-Cold War. We were in the post-post-Cold War: a struggle between an ad hoc “coalition of inclusion” — decent countries, not all of them democracies, that see their future as best delivered by a U.S.-led alliance nudging the world to greater economic integration, openness and collaboration to meet global challenges, like climate change — versus a “coalition of resistance,” led by Russia, Iran and North Korea: brutal, authoritarian regimes that use their opposition to the U.S.-led world of inclusion to justify militarizing their societies and maintaining an iron grip on power. China has been straddling the two camps because its economy depends on access to the coalition of inclusion while the government’s leadership shares a lot of the authoritarian instincts and interests of the coalition of resistance. You have to see the wars in Ukraine, Gaza and Lebanon in the context of this global struggle. Ukraine was trying to join the world of inclusion in Europe — seeking freedom from Russia’s orbit and to join the European Union — and Israel and Saudi Arabia were trying to expand the world of inclusion in the Middle East by normalizing relations. Russia attempted to stop Ukraine from joining the West (the European Union and NATO) and Iran, Hamas and Hezbollah attempted to stop Israel from joining the East (ties with Saudi Arabia). Because if Ukraine joined the European Union, the inclusive vision of a Europe “whole and free” would be almost complete and Vladimir Putin’s kleptocracy in Russia almost completely isolated. And if Israel were allowed to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia, not only would that vastly expand the coalition of inclusion in that region — a coalition already expanded by the Abraham Accords that created ties between Israel and other Arab nations — it would almost totally isolate Iran and its reckless proxies of Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and the pro-Iranian Shiite militias in Iraq, all of which were driving their countries into failed states. Indeed, it is hard to exaggerate how much Hezbollah and its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed by an Israeli strike on Friday, were detested in Lebanon and many parts of the Sunni and Christian Arab world for the way they had kidnapped Lebanon and turned it into a base for Iranian imperialism. I was speaking over the weekend to Orit Perlov, who tracks Arab social media for Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies. She described the flood of social media postings from across Lebanon and the Arab world celebrating Hezbollah’s demise and urging the Lebanese government to declare a unilateral cease-fire so the Lebanese Army could seize control of Southern Lebanon from Hezbollah and bring quiet to the border. The Lebanese don’t want Beirut to be destroyed like Gaza and they are truly afraid of a return of civil war, Perlov explained to me. Nasrallah had already dragged the Lebanese into a war with Israel they never wanted, but Iran ordered. This comes on top of the deep anger for the way Hezbollah joined with the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad to crush the democratic uprising there. It is literally as if the Wicked Witch from the Wizard of Oz is dead and now everyone is thanking Dorothy (i.e., Israel). But there is a lot of diplomatic work to be done to translate the end of Nasrallah to a sustainably better future for the Lebanese, Israelis and Palestinians. The Biden-Harris administration has been building a network of alliances to give strategic weight to the ad hoc coalition of inclusion — from Japan, Korea, the Philippines and Australia in the Far East, through India and across to Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and then up through the European Union and NATO. The keystone of the whole project was the Biden team’s proposed normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which the Saudis are ready to do, provided Israel agrees to open negotiations with the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank on a two-state solution. And here comes the rub. Pay very close attention to the speech by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel before the U.N. General Assembly on Friday. He understands very well the struggle between the coalitions of “resistance” and “inclusion” that I am talking about. In fact, it was central to his U.N. speech. How so? He held up two maps during his address, one titled “The Blessing” and the other “The Curse.” “The Curse” showed Syria, Iraq and Iran in black as a blocking coalition between the Middle East and Europe. The second map, “The Blessing,” showed the Middle East with Israel, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Sudan in green and a red two-way arrow going across them, as a bridge connecting the world of inclusion in Asia with the world of inclusion in Europe. Yet if you looked closely at the “Curse” map, it showed Israel, but no borders with Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank (as if it had already been annexed — the goal of this Israeli government). And that is the rub. The story Netanyahu wants to tell the world is that Iran and its proxies are the main obstacle to the world of inclusion stretching from Europe, through the Middle East, and over to the Asia-Pacific region. I beg to differ. The keystone to this whole alliance is a Saudi-Israel normalization based on reconciliation between Israel and moderate Palestinians. If Israel now moved ahead and opened a dialogue on two states for two peoples with a reformed Palestinian Authority, which has already accepted the Oslo peace treaty, it would be the diplomatic knockout blow that would accompany and solidify the military knockout blow Israel just delivered to Hezbollah and Hamas. It would totally isolate the forces of “resistance” in the region and take away their phony shield — that they are the defenders of the Palestinian cause. Nothing would rattle Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah and Russia, and even China, more. But to do that Netanyahu would have to take a political risk even greater than the military risk he just took in killing the leadership of Hezbollah, a.k.a. “the Party of God.” Netanyahu would have to break with the Israeli “Party of God” — the coalition of far-right Jewish settler supremacists and messianists who want Israel to permanently control all the territory from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean, with no border lines in between — just like on his U.N. map. Those parties keep him in power, so he would need to replace them with Israeli centrist parties, which I know would collaborate with him on such a move. So there you have the big challenge of the day: The struggle between the world of inclusion and the world of resistance comes down to many things, but none more — today — than Netanyahu’s willingness to follow up his blow to the “Party of God” in Lebanon by dealing a similar political blow to the “Party of God” in Israel.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,7,1224,0.208,0.256,0.165,0.44,0.5,0.321,0.315,0.638,0.226,0.5,0.5
153,45560,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,Why Everything Is Suddenly Spiraling for Israel,"What would you do? There is no other question that Israel’s government has posed to the world more often since Hamas invaded Israel on Oct. 7 and Hezbollah attacked Israel on Oct. 8. What would your country do if terrorists crossed your western border and killed, maimed, kidnapped or sexually abused hundreds of Israelis they encountered and the next day their Hezbollah allies sent rockets over your northern border, driving away thousands of civilians — all cheered on by Iran? What would you do? It is a powerful and relevant question and one that Israel’s critics often dodge. But they aren’t the only ones dodging it. This Israeli government, led by Benjamin Netanyahu, wants you and me and every Israeli and all of Israel’s friends — and even enemies — to believe that there was always only one right answer to that question: Invade Gaza, hunt down every Hamas leader and fighter, kill every last one and not be deterred by the civilian casualties, then pummel Hezbollah in Lebanon — and do both without spending time planning an exit strategy for either. I’ve argued from Day 1 that it was a trap, a trap I’m sorry to say the Biden administration was not firm enough in stopping Israel from falling into and not firm enough in insisting on a better road, a road not taken. This is no time to be pulling punches. The Jewish state of Israel is in grave, grave danger today. And the danger comes from both Iran and the current Israeli ruling coalition. You see, I have never had any illusions about the macro reasons this war happened. It is the unfolding of an Iranian grand strategy to slowly destroy the Jewish state, weaken America’s Arab allies and undermine U.S. influence in the region — while deterring Israel from ever attacking Iran’s nuclear facilities — by using Iranian proxies to bleed Israel to death. That is the macro story. The immediate trigger and goal of the war was a Hamas-Iranian interest to scuttle the Biden team’s diplomatic initiative to forge Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Saudi Arabia into a ring of peace. The Iranian-Hamas counterstrategy was to ignite a ring of fire around Israel, using Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, pro-Iranian Shiite militias in Iraq and West Bank militants armed by Iran with weapons smuggled through Jordan. The Iranian strategy is exquisite from Tehran’s point of view: Destroy Israel by sacrificing as many Palestinians and Lebanese as necessary but never risk a single Iranian life. The Iranians are ready to die to the last Lebanese, the last Palestinian, the last Syrian and the last Yemeni to eliminate Israel (and distract the world from the Iranian regime’s abuses of its own people and imperialist control over Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria). The problem for Israelis and the Jewish people is that while the Netanyahu government was right in its diagnosis that this was a war of annihilation, it refused to conduct the war in the only way that could hope to bring success — because that strategy ran counter to the political interests of the prime minister and the messianic ideological interests of his coalition. Israel faces an existential threat from the outside, and its prime minister and his allies have been prioritizing their own political and ideological interests ahead of that. They have even lately resurrected their judicial coup attempt to crush the Israeli Supreme Court — in the middle of a war of national survival while hostages rot in Gaza. It is one of the most shameful episodes in Jewish history, and shame on the AIPAC pro-Israel lobby in Washington for not speaking out against it. To counter this Iranian threat network, Israel needed four things: a lot of time, because this ring of fire could not be extinguished overnight; a lot of resources, particularly from the United States and other Western allies; a lot of Arab and European allies, because Israel cannot fight a war of attrition alone; and, perhaps most crucial of all, a lot of legitimacy. President Biden and his team offered Israel a road map for that counterstrategy but, sadly, they just never had the steel to impose it on Netanyahu with a combination of leverage, diplomacy and ultimatums. Such a road map would have involved persuading America’s Arab allies to fundamentally reform the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank with new, credible leadership and then getting Israel to agree to open negotiations with that Palestinian Authority leadership on a long-term pathway to a two-state solution. That would have done the following: 1) Opened the way to isolating and pressuring Hamas to agree to a cease-fire in which Israel gets out of Gaza in return for all the hostages — ending the war there and eliminating Hezbollah’s excuse for attacking Israel from the north. 2) Opened the way for Saudi Arabia to normalize relations with Israel — a devastating blow to Hamas and Iran. 3) Opened the way for the United Arab Emirates to partner with a reformed Palestinian Authority to put troops on the ground in Gaza and do the thing Hamas would hate most — replace it as the governing authority there, backed by hundreds of millions of dollars for rebuilding Gaza, which would probably make it the most popular Palestinian force in Gaza overnight. Up to now, though, Bibi has turned Biden down (while openly playing footsie with Donald Trump) because the prime minister would have had to break with the right-wing crazies who brought him to power and form a different governing coalition with more moderate parties. Bibi has prioritized his personal political security over Israel’s national security. And for months, he’s been spinning the world and his own people to disguise it. Netanyahu thought he could just tell the world that Israel was defending the frontier of freedom against Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and Iran and everyone would fall in line behind Israel. What would you do? But the only place in the world that that gets you a standing ovation is in the U.S. Congress. The rest of the world, particularly the moderate Arab states and the Europeans, told him: Bibi, you don’t have a clean story. You cannot tell the world you are defending the frontier of freedom against Hamas and Hezbollah while expanding — increasingly violently — Israel’s settler occupation over Palestinians in the West Bank. You don’t have a clean story. So the Israeli prime minister opted instead for the Netanyahu doctrine: Fight alone on three fronts — Gaza, Lebanon and the West Bank — with no plan for the morning after anywhere. In doing so, he rejected the Biden strategy: Embed Israel in a U.S.-Israeli-moderate-Arab coalition that would isolate Iran and its proxies, provide some hope that maybe one day we’d see two states for two indigenous peoples between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean and make clear to the world that the source of trouble in the region is not the Party of God in Israel but the Parties of God in Lebanon, Yemen and Iran. Netanyahu’s strategy is a disaster. As a veteran U.S. military commander who has observed close up Israel’s war strategy in Gaza told me privately, anyone with two eyes in his head knows that the only way to defeat Hamas is a strategy of “clear, hold and build”: Destroy the enemy, hold the territory and then build an alternative local, legitimate Palestinian governing authority. Israel’s strategy in Gaza, he said, has been: “Clear, leave, come back, clear again the same place, leave again, come back and clear again.” It is a textbook example of how to transform Hamas, he added, “from a quasi-military to a classic insurgency.” Did you read the lead article on Haaretz online the day of the remarkable Israeli pager attack on Hezbollah? If you did, you’d have found four young Israeli soldiers killed that day battling Hamas in Gaza staring back at you — almost a year after the war there started. Almost daily now you also read of large numbers of Gazan civilians killed in an Israeli operation against a few Hamas fighters living among them. Meanwhile, no one is governing Gaza. Yes, yes, I know the criticism: You are delusional. What Israeli or Palestinian leader would come together on such a plan? Well, two friends of mine have done just that: the former Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert and the former Palestinian Authority foreign minister Nasser al-Qudwa. You can check out their plan for a two-state solution right here. Biden should invite them both to the Oval Office on Thursday to embrace their project, which is totally in line with U.S. interests. I repeat: Israel is in terrible danger. It is fighting the most just war in its history — responding to the brutal, unprovoked murder and abduction of women and children and grandparents by Hamas — and yet today Israel is more of a pariah state than ever. Why? Because when you fight a war like this with no political horizon for this long — one that denies any possibility for more-moderate Palestinians to govern Gaza — the Israeli military operation there just starts to look like endless killing for killing’s sake. That is just what Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran want. There was always a road not taken. Do I know for sure it would work? Of course not. The only thing I know for sure is that the road that Netanyahu has Israel locked on now is a road to ruin, encircled by a ring of fire. Stay that course, and Israel’s most talented people will start to leave, and the Israel you knew will be gone forever.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,7,1610,0.087,0.143,0.091,0.155,0.296,0.171,0.253,0.341,0.183,0.5,0.371
154,45552,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,America’s Role in the World Is Hard. It Just Got Much Harder.,"Lately I’ve found myself beginning speeches about the foreign policy challenges facing the next president this way: “I want to speak today to all the parents in the room: Mom, Dad, if your son or daughter comes home from college and says, ‘I want to be the U.S. secretary of state someday,’ tell them: ‘Honey, whatever you want to be is fine, but please, please, don’t be secretary of state. It is the worst job in the world. Secretary of education, secretary of agriculture, secretary of commerce — no problem. But promise us that you won’t become secretary of state.’” The reason: The job of running U.S. foreign policy is far, far harder than most Americans have ever spent time considering. It’s a near-impossibility in an age when you have to manage superpowers, supercorporations, superempowered individuals and networks, superstorms, superfailing states and superintelligence — all intermingling with one another, creating an incredibly complex web of problems to untangle to get anything done. In the Cold War, heroic diplomacy was always within reach. Think of Henry Kissinger. He needed just three dimes, an airplane and a few months of shuttle diplomacy to put together the historic post-1973 October war disengagement agreements between Israel, Egypt and Syria. He used one dime to call President Anwar Sadat of Egypt, one dime to call Prime Minister Golda Meir of Israel and one dime to call President Hafez al-Assad of Syria. Presto: tic-tac-toe — Egypt, Syria and Israel in their first peace accords since the 1949 armistice agreements. Kissinger was dealing with countries. Antony Blinken was not so lucky when he became the 71st secretary of state in 2021. Blinken — along with the national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, and the C.I.A. director, Bill Burns — have played a difficult hand well, but just compare the Middle East they have had to deal with to Kissinger’s. The region has been transformed — from a region of solid nation-states to one increasingly made of failed states, zombie states and superempowered angry men armed with precision rockets. I am talking about Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria, the Houthis in Yemen and Shiite militias in Iraq. Virtually everywhere Blinken, Sullivan and Burns looked when they mounted their shuttle diplomacy after Oct. 7, 2023, they saw double — the official Lebanese government and Hezbollah’s network, the official Yemeni government and the Houthi network, and the official Iraqi government and the Iranian-directed Shiite militia networks. In Syria, you have a Syrian government in charge in Damascus, and the rest of the country is a patchwork of zones controlled by Russia, Iran, Turkey, Hezbollah, and U.S. and Kurdish forces. The Hamas network in Gaza could be reached only via Qatari and Egyptian mediators. And even Hamas had a military wing inside Gaza and a political wing outside Gaza. Meanwhile, Hezbollah is the first nonstate entity in modern history to have established mutual assured destruction with a nation-state. Hezbollah today can credibly threaten to destroy Tel Aviv Airport with its precision rockets every bit as much as Israel can threaten to destroy Beirut Airport. That was not true the last time they fought a war, in 2006. What was also not true back then was that Israel would have technology to kill or wound hundreds of Hezbollah members in one fell swoop, as it did on Tuesday by using “Matrix”-like cyber tools to detonate their pagers at once — while U.S. diplomats were working feverishly on a cease-fire between the two parties. So just when U.S. diplomats are trying to quiet the battlefield in physical space, the one in cyberspace erupts. Goodbye, tic-tac-toe. Today, getting the interests of all these entities aligned at once to secure a cease-fire in Gaza is as easy as getting all the same colors lined up on one side of a Rubik’s Cube. So, there is only one thing clear to me about this new world of geopolitics that our next president will have to manage: We need a lot of allies. This is not a job for an “America alone.” It is a job for “America and friends.” That is why the choice in this election for me is also clear. Do you want Donald Trump — whose two bumper-sticker messages to our allies are basically “Get off my lawn” and “Pay up, or I’ll hand you over to Putin” — as president or Kamala Harris, who comes out of a Biden administration whose signature foreign policy achievement has been its ability to build alliances? That is Joe Biden’s greatest legacy, and it is a substantial one. In the Asian-Pacific, the Biden team used alliances to counterbalance China militarily and technologically. In Europe, it used them to counter the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In the Middle East, it used them on April 13 to shoot down virtually all 300 or so drones and missiles that Iran fired at Israel. And in covert diplomacy, it gathered our allies for the complex, multination prisoner swap that freed, among others, the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, dishonestly jailed by Vladimir Putin. What is the No. 1 reason that Russia, Iran and China all want Trump elected? Because they know that he is so transactional when it comes to dealing with NATO and other U.S. allies that he can never assemble sustainable alliances against them. Have no doubts: The world in which our next president and secretary of state will have to lead is more challenging than at any time since before World War II. That is why I have found it quite helpful now to be reading a new book just out by Michael Mandelbaum, titled “The Titans of the Twentieth Century: How They Made History and the History They Made,” a study of the impact on history of Woodrow Wilson, V.I. Lenin, Adolf Hitler, Winston Churchill, Franklin Roosevelt, Mohandas Gandhi, David Ben-Gurion and Mao Zedong. The chapters on Churchill and Roosevelt are particularly relevant to the present. These two greatest democratic leaders of the 20th century recognized the dictatorships in Germany and Japan early on for what they were — and knew that they threatened Britain and America. But what they also understood was that neither of their countries could have won World War II alone (or without the Soviet Union). Alliances were crucial. “Maintaining alliances is never easy,” Mandelbaum told me. “Churchill and F.D.R. were not personally as close as they have often been portrayed as being and had important political disagreements. Each understood, however, that he needed the other, and they made their partnership work. Maintaining and strengthening America’s global partnerships in the face of a dangerous world will be a major task for the next commander in chief.” This is especially true at a time when we are not as prepared militarily for the world we’re entering as we need to be. Russia, Iran and China have all been engaged in significant military buildups for years. We, by contrast, literally lack the weaponry today to fight on all three fronts at once. The only way to cope with that potential problem is not to abandon one or more of these regions but to add others’ strength to our own via alliances, which was, as it happens, the key to our success in the two World Wars and the Cold War. Also, “a leader sometimes has to ask for sacrifice,” Mandelbaum added. “That request can only be effective if the leader has a reputation for credibility. And credibility, in turn, requires candor.” Both Roosevelt and Churchill “communicated the choices their countries faced clearly, honestly and eloquently.” Here, I have to say, Trump still may have an advantage. He is honest about his awful views. He’s signaled that he does not care whether Ukraine wins or loses to Russia. Unfortunately, when Harris was asked at the debate, “Do you believe you bear any responsibility in the way that withdrawal played out” in Afghanistan that led to the deaths of 13 U.S. service members, she totally dodged the question. Big mistake. I’m certain that undecided voters noticed that — not to Harris’s advantage. Her answer should have been: “I was gutted by those deaths. I will never forget hearing the news in the Situation Room, because that is where the buck stops. But most of all I will never forget what I learned from that experience. It will never be repeated in my presidency.” She would have won votes with an answer like that — from voters who worry that she’s much more “left” than she lets on. Alas, there’s another reason China prefers Trump. He not only detests illegal immigration; as president he cracked down on legal immigration to appeal to right-wing nativists. That’s music to China’s ears. It weakens America’s key advantage over China — our ability to attract talent from everywhere. For instance, how many Americans know that the U.S.-led A.I. revolution made a giant leap forward in 2017 when Google released to the world one of the most important technology algorithms ever written? It established a deep learning architecture — the “transformer” — for processing language that “kick-started an entirely new era of artificial intelligence: the rise of generative A.I.,” like Bard and ChatGPT, as the Financial Times put it. That algorithm was written by a team of eight Google A.I. researchers in Mountain View, Calif. They were, the FT noted: Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Jakob Uszkoreit, Illia Polosukhin and Llion Jones, “as well as Aidan Gomez, an intern then studying at the University of Toronto, and Niki Parmar, a recent master’s graduate on Uszkoreit’s team, from Pune in western India. The eighth author was Lukasz Kaiser, who was also a part-time academic at France’s National Centre for Scientific Research.” Their “educational, professional and geographic diversity — coming from backgrounds as varied as Ukraine, India, Germany, Poland, Britain, Canada and the U.S. — made them unique,” the FT wrote. It was also “‘absolutely essential for this work to happen,’ says Uszkoreit, who grew up between the U.S. and Germany.” I’m sure Harris is up to the job of commander in chief. But more candor from her now — to show that she has the steel to take on the most impossible foreign policy challenges and take on her own progressive base if she needs to — would convince more undecided voters that she has the steel to take on Putin. As for Trump, he is strong and wrong on the two key foreign policy issues — alliances and immigrants. His default option — America alone — is a prescription for America weak, America isolated, America vulnerable and America in decline.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,12,1770,0.136,0.472,0.597,0.5,0.5,0.435,0.493,0.5,0.421,0.5,0.384
155,45538,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,"How Netanyahu Is Trying to Save Himself, Elect Trump and Defeat Harris","If President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris needed any reminder that Benjamin Netanyahu is not their friend, not America’s friend and, most shamefully, not the friend of the Israeli hostages in Gaza, the murder by Hamas of six Israeli souls while Netanyahu dragged out negotiations should make that clear. Netanyahu has one interest: his own immediate political survival, even if it undermines Israel’s long-term survival. Madam Vice President, have no doubt, this will lead him to do things in the next two months that could seriously harm your election chances and strengthen Donald Trump’s. Be afraid. Meanwhile, Mr. President, please, please tell me that Netanyahu has not played you for a fool. You have had repeated conversations with him, each followed by your optimistic predictions about an imminent cease-fire in Gaza — and then he tells his followers something else. Netanyahu is one reason that I coined this rule about Middle East reporting: In Washington, officials tell you the truth in private and lie in public. In the Middle East, officials lie to you in private and tell the truth in public. Never trust what they say to you in private — especially Netanyahu. Listen only to what they say in public to their own people in their own languages. In his phone calls, Netanyahu has been whispering to America’s leaders in English that he is interested in a cease-fire and a hostage deal and is considering the necessary precursors for what I call the Biden Doctrine. But as soon as he hangs up, in Hebrew, he says things to his base that expressly contradict the Biden Doctrine, because it threatens the Bibi Doctrine. So, what is the Biden Doctrine, and what is the Bibi Doctrine, and why do they matter? The Biden administration has built an impressive set of regional alliances with partners stretching from Japan, South Korea and the Philippines in the Asia Pacific region to India and the Persian Gulf, up to NATO in Europe. They are security and economic coalitions, designed to counter Russia in Europe, contain China in the Pacific and isolate Iran in the Middle East. Alas, though, a keystone for all these alliances — meant to connect Asia, the Middle East and Europe — was Biden’s proposed defense alliance with Saudi Arabia. The key to getting such a deal through Congress would be Saudi Arabia agreeing to normalize relations with Israel. And the key to getting the Saudis to do that would be Netanyahu agreeing to discuss — just discuss — the possibility of a two-state solution with the Palestinians one day. Since the Gaza war started last October, the Biden team has been wisely trying to meld the Biden Doctrine with a Gaza cease-fire and hostage deal, by stressing the significant advantages for both Israel and America: It could lead to a permanent cease-fire in Gaza, bring about the return of the hostages and give the exhausted Israeli standing army and reserve force a much-needed break, since a Gaza cease-fire would almost certainly compel Hezbollah to cease firing from Lebanon as well. If Israel then would agree to open talks with the Palestinian Authority on a two-state solution, it would pave the way for normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia — a huge strategic asset for Israel — and create conditions for the U.A.E., Morocco and Egypt to send peacekeeping troops to Gaza in partnership with an upgraded Palestinian Authority, so Israel would not need a permanent occupation there and Hamas would be replaced by a legitimate, moderate Palestinian government — Hamas’s nightmare. In one move, Biden has been telling Netanyahu, Israel could find sustainable Arab partners for a secure pathway out of Gaza and find Arab allies for the regional alliance it needs to counter Iran’s regional alliance of Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthis and Iraqi militias. Biden’s point: Israel’s security today has to be seen in a much wider context than just who patrols the Gaza border. But the Biden Doctrine ran directly into the Bibi Doctrine, which centers on doing everything possible to avoid any political process with the Palestinians that may require a territorial compromise in the West Bank that would break Netanyahu’s political alliance with the Israeli far right. To that end, Bibi has made sure for years that Palestinians remain divided and unable to have a unified position. He ensured that Hamas remained a viable governing entity in Gaza by, among other things, arranging for Qatar to send Hamas more than $1 billion for humanitarian aid, fuel and government salaries from 2012 to 2018. At the same time, Netanyahu did everything he could to discredit and humiliate the Palestinian Authority and its president, Mahmoud Abbas, who has recognized Israel, embraced the Oslo peace process and partnered with Israel’s security services to try to keep the peace in the West Bank for nearly three decades. Netanyahu’s survival doctrine became even more important after he was indicted in 2019 on charges of fraud, bribery and breach of trust. Now he must stay in power to stay out of prison, if convicted. (American readers, does this have a familiar ring?) Therefore, when Netanyahu won re-election by a razor-thin margin in 2022, he was ready to climb into bed with the worst of the worst in Israeli politics to form a governing coalition that would keep him in power. I am talking about a group of radical Jewish supremacists whom a former Israeli Mossad chief called “horrible racists” and “a lot worse” than the Ku Klux Klan. These Jewish supremacists agreed to let Netanyahu be prime minister as long as he retained permanent Israeli military control over the West Bank and, after Oct. 7, over Gaza as well. They effectively told Bibi that if he ever agreed to Biden’s U.S.-Saudi-Israel-Palestinian Authority deal — or agreed to an immediate cease-fire for the return of Israeli hostages and the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails — they would topple his government. Because those things would be precursors for implementing the Biden Doctrine and a possible territorial compromise one day in the West Bank. Netanyahu got the message. He declared that he would end the war in Gaza after Israel achieved “total victory,” but never defined exactly what that would mean and who would govern Gaza in its wake. By establishing such an unattainable goal in Gaza — the Israeli military has been occupying the West Bank for 57 years and, as the daily clashes demonstrate, has not achieved “total victory” over Hamas militants there — Bibi set things up so he alone can decide when the war in Gaza is over. Which will be when it suits his political survival needs. That is certainly not today. On Monday, Netanyahu declared that he is ready to sacrifice any cease-fire with Hamas and hostage return if it means Israel has to give in to the Hamas demand that Israel vacate its military outposts on the 8.7-mile-long Philadelphi Corridor along the Gaza-Egypt border, long used by Hamas to smuggle in weapons but which the Israeli military did not think important enough to even occupy for the first seven months of the war. Israeli generals have consistently told Netanyahu there are many alternative effective means for controlling the corridor now and that supporting Israeli troops marooned out there would be difficult and dangerous. And they could retake it any time they need. Staying there is already causing huge problems with the Egyptians, too. No matter: Netanyahu publicly declared Monday that the corridor “is central, it determines all of our future.” The whole thing is a fraud. As the Haaretz military correspondent Amos Harel explained, what is really going on is that Bibi’s right-wing allies dream of resettling Gaza, while “Netanyahu, under cover of security interests, is mainly protecting his political position. He is fighting for the integrity of his governing coalition, which might crack if a deal is approved.” Which is why Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant — the only honest, courageous person in Netanyahu’s cabinet — reportedly told the prime minister and his right-wing sycophants that their vote last Thursday to “prioritize the Philadelphi Corridor at the cost of the lives of the hostages is a moral disgrace.” Now back to America’s presidential election. Netanyahu clearly knows that he has Harris in a bind. If he continues the war in Gaza until “total victory,” with more civilian casualties, he will force Harris either to publicly criticize him and lose Jewish votes or bite her tongue and lose Arab and Muslim American votes in the key state of Michigan. As Harris will likely find it hard to do either, this will make her look weak to both American Jews and American Arabs. Based on my reporting and all my years watching Netanyahu, I would not be surprised if he actually escalates in Gaza between now and Election Day to make life difficult for the Democrats running for office. (The murderous Islamo-fascist leader of Hamas, Yahya Sinwar, also wants to see the war continue because it is tearing Israel apart and isolating America in the region.) Netanyahu may do this because, I believe, he wants Trump to win and he wants to be able to tell Trump that he helped him win. Netanyahu knows that many in the rising generation of Democrats are hostile to Israel — or at least to the Israel he is creating. Then, if Trump wins, I would not be shocked if Bibi declares that his “total victory” in Gaza has been achieved, agrees to some cease-fire to get back any hostages still alive, mumbles a few words about Palestinian statehood in the far-off, distant future to get the Saudi-Israel normalization deal and tells his craziest far-right partners to get lost while he runs for re-election without them. His likely platform: I brought total victory in Gaza and, with Trump, forged a historic opening between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Netanyahu wins. Trump wins. Israel loses. Gaza will still be boiling, of course. Israeli troops will still be occupying it. Israel will be more of a pariah state than ever, with more and more talented Israelis leaving for jobs abroad, but Bibi will have another term — and that is all that counts. (If Harris wins, Bibi knows he just needs to snap his fingers and the pro-Israel lobby in Washington — AIPAC — and Republicans in Congress will protect him from any blowback.) Then, one day down the road, I fully expect that Bibi will organize a ceremony to honor his “dear friend of many years, President Joe Biden.” It will be a new settlement in Gaza, called, in Hebrew, Givat Yosef.

156,45505,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,America May Soon Face a Fateful Choice About Iran,"One of my ironclad rules of reporting in the Middle East is that sometimes you need to rereport a story to see things even more clearly than you did earlier. I’m having that experience with the Iran-Israel-Hamas-Hezbollah war, which could soon draw in the United States. It could not be more clear now that, while Hamas’s surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7 was triggered in part by reckless Israeli settlement expansions, brutal treatment of Palestinian prisoners and encroachments on Muslim religious sites in Jerusalem, the terrorist assault was also part of a broader Iranian campaign to drive America out of the Middle East and America’s Arab and Israeli allies into a corner — before they could corner Iran. Which is why if the current tit-for-tat conflict between Israel and Iran and Iran’s proxies (Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis) escalates into a full-scale war — one that Israel could not fight for very long alone — President Biden could face the most fateful decision of his presidency: whether to go to war with Iran, alongside Israel, and take out Tehran’s nuclear program, which is the keystone of Iran’s strategic network in the region. Iran has been building that network to supplant America as the most powerful force in the Middle East and to bleed Israel to death by a thousand cuts inflicted by its proxies. But America must always be wary about what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is up to. As a former Israeli diplomat, Alon Pinkas, observed in Haaretz on Thursday, one has to wonder why Netanyahu chose now to assassinate the Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran — in the middle of delicate hostage talks. Was it just because it could (lord knows Haniyeh had a lot of Israeli blood on his hands), or was Israel “deliberately provoking escalation in the hope that a conflagration with Iran will drag the United States into the conflict, further distancing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from the debacle of Oct. 7 — a calamity that to this day he has not been held accountable for.” In Netanyahu’s nearly 17 years in power, Bibi has both aided and undermined American interests in the region. I would not trust Netanyahu for a second to put U.S. interests ahead of his own political survival needs — since he won’t even put Israel’s interests ahead of them. But honesty also requires me to acknowledge that some things are true even if Netanyahu believes them. And one of those things is that Iran is the biggest indigenous imperial power in the Middle East, and through its proxies it has been dominating the politics of millions of Arabs living in Lebanon, Syria, Gaza, Iraq and Yemen — dragging their citizens into wars with Israel that few of them have any interest in. No leader in any of these Arab states today can make decisions hostile to Iran’s interests without fear of being killed. Lebanon has not been able to appoint a president since Oct. 30, 2022, in large part because Tehran won’t allow an independent Lebanese patriot to be in charge there. Lebanon and Syria had to observe three days of mourning after Iran’s president died in a helicopter crash. Yup, three days of mourning for another country’s president. There is a name for that: Iranian imperialism. Some things are also true even if Iran believes them, too. And one of those is that Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, have been quietly and effectively building a network of extensive alliances over the past few years to contain China and isolate Iran. One is the new economic grouping called I2-U2, which includes India, Israel, the United Arab Emirates and the U.S. And the other — even more important — is the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, known as IMEC. IMEC was designed to foster tighter trade and energy supply links between the European Union and India — via U.S. allies on the Persian Gulf. The goal: to help India escape from China’s efforts to encircle New Delhi through its Belt and Road infrastructure initiative and to create a grand, pro-American geoeconomic alliance stretching from the E.U. through Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. all the way over to India that would also isolate Iran. The founding IMEC partners are the U.S., the E.U., Saudi Arabia, India, the U.A.E., France, Germany and Italy. The American plan was to give military weight to these interlocking alliances by forging, at their heart, a mutual defense treaty with Saudi Arabia that would also involve Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel, provided that Israel agreed to make progress toward a two-state solution with the Palestinians. Once forged, this would mean that all of America’s Middle East allies would be operating as a counter-Iranian team — Jordan, Egypt, the U.A.E., Israel, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain in particular. Iran knew it had to prevent this Saudi-U.S.-Israel deal or be strategically isolated. Hamas knew it had to prevent this deal because it could enable Israel’s integration into the Muslim world — in partnership with Hamas’s chief Palestinian rival, the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah, and with Saudi Arabia. How do we know Iran believed this? Because Iran’s supreme leader told us so four days before Hamas invaded Israel. It is rather chilling to read today this story in The Times of Israel from Oct. 3, 2023: Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei said that Muslim countries that are normalizing with Israel are “betting on a losing horse,” state-run media reported Tuesday, as regional rival Saudi Arabia moves toward establishing ties with Jerusalem. Khamenei also predicted Israel would soon be eradicated, in an address to government officials and ambassadors from Muslim countries. … “The definitive stance of the Islamic republic is that the governments which prioritize the gamble of normalization with the Zionist regime will incur losses,” he said. … “Today, the situation of the Zionist regime is not one that should motivate closeness to it; they shouldn’t make this mistake.” Whether or not Iran knew of the precise timing in advance, Iran surely saw Hamas’s invasion as a way of isolating Israel and its American patron by forcing Israel to inflict thousands of civilian casualties to defeat Hamas’s underground network and undermine any Saudi-Palestinian-Israeli normalization. That is the larger story here. How, though, will it end? In the past month Israel assassinated the senior Hezbollah commander, Fuad Shukr in Beirut; Hamas’s political leader, Haniyeh; and Muhammad Deif, the Hamas military commander, in Gaza. They were all obsessed with dragging their people into endless war to destroy the Jewish state. But Israel killed the No. 1 and No. 2 leaders of Hamas before. The problem is, Hamas and Hezbollah are networks, and as the network strategist John Arquilla, the author of “Bitskrieg: The New Challenge of Cyberwarfare,” once taught me, “In a network, everyone is No. 2.” Successors always emerge, often worse than their predecessors. The only way to truly marginalize Hamas politically and isolate Iran regionally is for Israel to help empower the obvious and more moderate alternative: the Palestinian Authority, which has embraced the Oslo Accords and cooperates with Israel daily to try to keep a lid on West Bank violence — which Netanyahu knows very well but will not acknowledge because he wants to delegitimize any credible Palestinian alternative to Hamas so he can tell the world, and Israelis, that Israel has no partner for a two-state solution. With that one chess move — embracing the Palestinian Authority — Netanyahu could cement the U.S.-Israeli-Arab alliance, put in place a Palestinian governing structure in Gaza that would not threaten Israel and isolate Iran and its proxies militarily and politically, making their bet on Hamas’s war an utter waste of lives and money. But Bibi would have to risk his governing coalition to do it, because his extremist far-right messianic partners oppose any deal with any credible Palestinians. Bottom line: I believed early on in the Gaza war that these were the real stakes, but now they are crystal clear. What is not at all clear is what Bibi will do. Whose interests will he serve? His, Israel’s, America’s or Iran’s? Because if Netanyahu made the right move now, it would leave Iran naked politically. Iran would no longer be able to disguise its goal to control the whole Arab world by hiding itself and its proxies behind the Palestinian cause. Iran has long been happy to let Palestinians, Lebanese, Yemenis, Iraqis and Syrians die “for Palestine” but never risk Iranians if it could avoid that. The crocodile tears shed by Iran’s clerical leaders for Palestinians are all a fraud — all just a cover for Tehran’s regional imperialist adventure. Netanyahu can now pull back the curtain on the whole cynical play. But that would require him to put Israel’s interests ahead of his own political survival.

157,45461,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,American Leaders Should Stop Debasing Themselves on Israel,"On Nov. 4, 2022, just after the current far-right Israeli government coalition won election, I wrote a column with this headline: “The Israel We Knew Is Gone.” It was meant to be a warning flare about just how radical this coalition is. Many people disagreed. I believe events have proved them wrong — and the situation is now even worse: The Israel we knew is gone, and today’s Israel is in existential danger. Israel is up against a regional superpower, Iran, that has managed to put Israel into a vise grip, using its allies and proxies: Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and Shiite militias in Iraq. Right now, Israel has no military or diplomatic answer. Worse, it faces the prospect of a war on three fronts — Gaza, Lebanon and the West Bank — but with a dangerous new twist: Hezbollah in Lebanon, unlike Hamas, is armed with precision missiles that could destroy vast swaths of Israel’s infrastructure, from its airports to its seaports to its university campuses to its military bases to its power plants. But Israel is led by a prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who has to stay in power to avoid potentially being sent to prison on corruption charges. To do so, he sold his soul to form a government with far-right Jewish extremists who insist that Israel must fight in Gaza until it has killed every last Hamasnik — “total victory” — and who reject any partnership with the Palestinian Authority (which has accepted the Oslo peace accords) in governing a post-Hamas Gaza, because they want Israeli control over all the territory between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, including Gaza. And now, Netanyahu’s emergency war cabinet has fallen apart over his lack of a plan for ending the war and safely withdrawing from Gaza, and the extremists in his government coalition are eyeing their next moves for power. They have done so much damage already, and yet President Biden, the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC and many in Congress have not come to terms with just how radical this government is. Indeed, House Speaker Mike Johnson and his fellow G.O.P. mischief makers decided to reward Netanyahu with the high honor of speaking to a joint meeting of Congress on July 24. Pushed into a corner, the top Democrats in the Senate and the House signed on to the invitation, but the unstated goal of this Republican exercise is to divide Democrats and provoke shouted insults from their most progressive representatives that would alienate American Jewish voters and donors and turn them toward Donald Trump. Netanyahu knows that this is all about domestic U.S. politics, which is why his acceptance of the speaking invitation is such an act of disloyalty to Joe Biden — who flew all the way to Israel to hug him in the days after Oct. 7 — that it simply takes your breath away. No friend of Israel should participate in this circus. Israel needs a pragmatic centrist government that can lead it out of this multifaceted crisis — and seize the offer of normalization with Saudi Arabia that Biden has been able to engineer. This can come about only by removing Netanyahu through a new election — as the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, bravely called for in March. Israel does not need a U.S.-sponsored booze party for its drunken driver. You wonder if the “friends” of Israel have any clue about the nature of its government. This government is not your grandfather’s Israel and this Bibi is not even the old Bibi. Unlike any previous Israeli cabinet, this government wrote the goal of annexing the West Bank into the coalition agreement, so it is no surprise that it spent its first year trying to crush the ability of the Israeli Supreme Court to put any check on its powers. Bibi also ceded control over the police and key authorities in the Defense Ministry to Jewish supremacists in his coalition to enable them to deepen settlers’ control over the West Bank. They immediately proceeded to add settlement housing units in the heart of that occupied territory by record numbers to try to block any Palestinian state there. This nightmare coalition is now in the process of ensuring that ultra-Orthodox young men will not have to serve in this war in equal weight with secular young men and women, who are exhausted by eight months of fighting. The army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, told soldiers in Gaza over the weekend that there “is now a clear need” to draft the ultra-Orthodox to be soldiers to spare another deployment for “many thousands” of less religious reservists. Israel’s relatively small combat officer corps has been so ground down, I cannot imagine how it could sustain a war in Lebanon. Add it all up and you see a reckless act of economic, military and moral overstretch — committing seven million Jews to control more than seven million Palestinians (including two million Israeli Arabs) between the river and the sea in perpetuity. That would be madness in a time of peace. In a time of war — a low-grade three-front war that could become a high-grade three-front war any day — it is insane. Israel is increasingly alone, because what ally would want to partner with that agenda? And that is why I agree with every word that former Prime Minister Ehud Barak wrote in Haaretz last Thursday: Israel faces “the most serious and dangerous crisis in the country’s history. It began on Oct. 7 with the worst failure in Israel’s history. And it continued with a war that, despite the courage and sacrifice of soldiers and officers, appears to be the least successful war in its history, due to the strategic paralysis in the country’s leadership.” Israel, added Barak, a former army chief of staff, is “risking a multifront war that would include Iran and its proxies. And all this is happening while in the background the judicial coup continues, with its goal of establishing a racist, ultranationalist, messianic and benighted religious dictatorship.” Barak warned that if the current government is allowed to remain in power, Israel will not only find itself stuck in Gaza — with Hamas still able to fight and no Arab partner to help Israel out of there — it will also most likely find itself “in an all-out war with Hezbollah in the north, a third intifada in the West Bank, conflicts with the Houthis in Yemen and Iraqi militias in the Golan Heights and, of course, conflict with Iran itself.” Every American should worry about that. It is a prescription for the United States to be dragged into a Middle East war to help Israel — which would be a Russian, Chinese, Iranian dream come true. Indeed, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who has made eight trips to Israel since Oct. 7, should not make another without Israel and Hamas agreeing to a clear war-ending plan. He is debasing his and U.S. power. This is ultimatum time. Biden should be telling Israel that it should accept Hamas’s key demand: Totally end the war now and withdraw from Gaza in exchange for the return of all Israeli hostages. Israel cannot think straight while Hamas holds its people. If Israel can end the war in Gaza, it can lead to a U.S.-mediated deal with Hezbollah to quiet the northern border war — which has been terrible for civilians on both sides. It could enable Israelis and Lebanese along their countries’ border to return home while enabling the Israeli Army to recover and restock from a draining fight. It could halt the erosion in both Israel’s economy and its global moral standing and let the country do something it should have done on Oct. 8. That is: pause, rethink, strategize and not do exactly what Iran and Hamas wanted it to do — i.e., charge ahead just as America did after Sept. 11, 2001 — and sink into an endless war without any plan or partner for the morning after. And, as Barak argued, Israel must then hold new elections. Yes, yes, I can hear the criticism from the war hawks right now: “Friedman, you would let Hamas’s leader, Yahya Sinwar, come out of his tunnel and declare victory?” Yes, I would. In fact, I wish I could be at the news conference in Gaza when he does, so I could ask the first question: “Mr. Sinwar, you claim this is a great victory for Hamas — a total Israeli withdrawal and a stable cease-fire. I just want to know: What existed on Oct. 6 between you and Israel, before your surprise attack? Oh, let me answer that: a total Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a stable cease-fire. If you don’t mind, I’d like to stick around for a few days to watch you explain to Gazans how you started an eight-month war — causing the destruction of roughly 70 percent of Gaza’s housing stock and leaving, by your count, some 37,000 Gazans dead, many of them women and children — so you could get Gaza back to exactly where it was on Oct. 6, in a cease-fire with Israel and no Israeli troops here. Another Hamas victory like this and Gaza will be permanently unlivable.” And to Israelis who would ask, “Friedman, are you crazy, you would let Sinwar run Gaza again?” my answer would again be — yes, for now. The alternatives — Israel running Gaza or Gaza becoming another Somalia — are far worse. Netanyahu’s idea that some perfect Palestinians — who are neither members of Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority — will run the place for Israel is a fantasy. The only people who can defeat Hamas are the Palestinians of Gaza. They, too, need better leadership, and if they find it, we should help them rebuild. But until then, Israel would be crazy to want to stay in Gaza and be responsible for its reconstruction. That honor should go to Sinwar. I believe that the morning after the morning after Sinwar emerges from his tunnel, many Gazans will want to pummel him for the disaster he has visited on them. And if not, Sinwar and Sinwar alone will be responsible when the water doesn’t flow, when the building materials don’t arrive, when the sun doesn’t shine — not Israel. And if he is so foolish as to restart the war with Israel or attempt to smuggle in weapons instead of food and housing for his people, it will all be on him. Sadly, if all this war does is buy Israel another long timeout with Hamas, well, maybe that’s all that’s possible. After all, up to now, the real history of Jews and Palestinians, going back to the early 20th century, has been: war, timeout, war, timeout, war, timeout, war, timeout, war, timeout. And the real difference is what each side did in the timeouts. Maybe one day that will change, but for now Israel needs to get the hell out of Gaza and back into a timeout.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,8,1842,0.192,0.094,0.107,0.188,0.08,0.137,0.138,0.13,0.158,0.5,0.263
158,45433,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,"Bibi Is Choosing Stefanik and Trump. President Biden, Don’t Be Fooled.","If you are keeping score at home, you have surely noticed that the two most important defense officials in Benjamin Netanyahu’s war cabinet — Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and the former military chief of staff Benny Gantz — warned last week that Netanyahu is leading Israel into a disastrous abyss by refusing to present any plan for non-Hamas Palestinians to govern Gaza and appears to be contemplating a long-term Israeli military occupation of Gaza instead. Gantz said he would leave the government if there was no plan by June 8. Here are the stakes for America in what these ministers are saying: Netanyahu has become a radical actor, undermining key U.S. interests and Arab allies, and becoming the gift that keeps on giving for Iran. Just look at the policy choices Netanyahu has made and tell me with a straight face that he has not let Israel be completely outmaneuvered by Iran. Using its allies Hamas and Hezbollah, Iran has shrunk Israel since Oct. 7 — forcing tens of thousands of Israelis off Israel’s western and northern borders and isolating the country on the world stage over Gaza — while Iran has become a threshold nuclear power and the biggest imperialist force in the region (given that it effectively controls four Arab states) and is less isolated than it has been in years. All of this has happened on Bibi’s watch. But now Netanyahu is busy doing something even more dangerous for Israel’s future — and for America. He is relentlessly pounding into the Israeli public’s mind-set that there is no difference between the Muslim Brotherhood-inspired Hamas, which is dedicated to wiping the Jewish state off the map and replacing it with an Islamic one, and the secular, Fatah-led Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, which embraced the Oslo Accords in the mid-1990s calling for a two-state solution and collaborated with Israel for three decades to limit violence in the West Bank. The Palestinian Authority has a million flaws, some created or exacerbated by violent Israeli settlers. But there is a reason Netanyahu panicked every time its leader, Mahmoud Abbas, would say, in effect: “OK, Bibi, you want to control the West Bank all by yourself? Here are the keys.” It’s because Netanyahu knows very well how much the Palestinian Authority cooperates with the Israeli Army and the Shin Bet security service to keep a lid on the West Bank — and how much it would cost Israel in money, soldiers and legitimacy if Israel had to alone run West Bank Palestinian security, health, banking, education. And yet, because Netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners want to annex Gaza — and their votes can keep him in office and out of jail if he is convicted in his corruption trials — Bibi is singing their line that Hamas and Fatah are the same. (This is the most important dynamic going on now, and the decision by the International Criminal Court to seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant and the leaders of Hamas on charges of war crimes only strengthens Bibi at home and deflects attention from this.) Worse, too many Israelis are buying Netanyahu’s nonsensical argument, and too few opposition leaders — including Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot — are standing up and clearly rejecting it. This is a looming disaster: Bibi is talking Israelis out of having any legitimate Palestinian alternative to Hamas rule. That’s the implication of claiming Hamas and Fatah are the same. And Netanyahu is doing all of this at the direction of the Jewish supremacist ministers in his cabinet to whom he has given unprecedented powers — finance minister Bezalel Smotrich and national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. “We must return to Gaza now! We are coming home to the Holy Land!” Ben-Gvir said during an Israeli Independence Day march last week, without rebuke from Netanyahu. “We must encourage emigration. Encourage the voluntary emigration of the residents of Gaza.” He is not a lone voice. Netanyahu’s incoming military secretary has reportedly drawn up his own plan — without input from the defense minister or the army chief of staff — for Israel to permanently govern Gaza with a military administration. Gallant — the former head of Israel’s equivalent of the Navy SEALs and the only person of political courage and gravitas in Netanyahu’s Likud party leadership — became so alarmed that last week, without permission of the prime minister, he delivered a speech saying that since October he has been asking Netanyahu for a plan for who will rule Gaza once Hamas is dismantled, but has “received no response.” Without a plan, Gallant added, “only two negative options remain: Hamas’s rule in Gaza or Israeli military rule in Gaza. … The ‘day after Hamas’ will only be achieved with Palestinian entities taking control of Gaza, accompanied by international actors, establishing a governing alternative to Hamas’s rule.” Although Gallant did not mention Palestinian Authority participation, he did not rule it out. But Netanyahu has made his position clear: “Gaza will be neither Hamastan nor Fatahstan,” as he put it this winter. Fatah is President Abbas’s party. Netanyahu’s now-constant repetition of the line that the Palestinian Authority is the same as Hamas is leading some to ask whether we are misreading Netanyahu, said Victor Friedman (no relation), an Israeli organizational psychologist. “Netanyahu’s acquiescence to the extreme right, Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, has generally been seen as motivated out of his need to keep his coalition together and himself out of jail,” Friedman told me. “Now it seems that he has willingly sold his soul to the extreme right. One explanation is that the extreme religious right projects a Messianic image onto him that corresponds with his own sense of having been called to save Israel and the Jewish people. He has a plan for the day after and it’s very clear to anyone who listens: ‘Total victory’ — and eventually the return of Jewish settlement there. Israel is on the way to reoccupying Gaza.” If that happens, Israel will become an international pariah and Jewish institutions everywhere will be torn between Jews who will feel the need to defend Israel — right or wrong — and those who, with their kids, will find it indefensible. Alas, Netanyahu has not driven Israel into its current dead end alone. For years his settlement project and Iran policies were given cover by AIPAC, America’s pro-Israel lobby; the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations; the American Jewish Committee; and knee-jerk supporters in both the Republican and Democratic Parties. And unfortunately, I don’t think President Biden fully understands his “old friend” Bibi, whose government is the first to ever formally declare annexation of the West Bank as its goal and actually tried to strip the Supreme Court of its power to stop it. My rule: Never listen to what Bibi tells you in private in English. Only watch what he says in public in Hebrew. For months, the Biden team has beseeched Netanyahu to articulate a post-Gaza vision that would involve Palestinian and Arab control over Gaza and a long-term pathway to demilitarized Palestinian statehood — so that the United States is not facilitating an Israeli occupation of Gaza, along with the West Bank — and to pave the way for a U.S.-Saudi security pact that could also produce normalized relations between Israel and the Saudis. Netanyahu has said no to all of it. He did, though, show his gratitude to Biden by having his parliamentary majority give Elise Stefanik, a hack Republican congresswoman with no foreign policy standing whatsoever — and a person groveling to become Donald Trump’s vice president — the extraordinary honor of giving an address Sunday in the Knesset, where she slammed the U.S. president and praised Trump. And who is this great military genius they are all indulging? Let’s see: In 2015, the Obama team concluded a nuclear deal with Iran that imposed inspections and restrictions on Iran — slashing its stock of enriched uranium to a small amount enriched to up to 3.67 percent purity, far from the roughly 90 percent purity needed for a bomb. So even if Iran tried to break out, it would need at least a year to produce enough fissile material for a bomb, plenty of time to stop it. Netanyahu bitterly opposed the deal, even though several top Israeli military and intelligence officials favored it, which Bibi kept hidden from the Israeli and U.S. publics. After Trump came to power Netanyahu lobbied him hard to tear up the deal, which Trump recklessly did in May 2018. Netanyahu was apparently counting on the fact that if Iran broke out of the deal and began enriching toward a bomb, Trump would blow up Iran’s nuclear facilities. Iran broke out, but neither Trump nor Biden was prepared to launch an attack on Iran. The result? As Reuters reported last month, “Iran is now enriching uranium to up to 60 percent purity and has enough material enriched to that level, if enriched further, for two nuclear weapons, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency’s theoretical definition. That means Iran’s so-called breakout time — the time it would need to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a nuclear bomb — is close to zero, likely a matter of weeks or days.” This is one of the greatest U.S.-Israeli national security fiascos of all time. And over the past decade it was Netanyahu — “Mr. Security” — who facilitated the transfer of over $1 billion from Qatar to Hamas, to build it up in Gaza, and used his voice to delegitimize the Palestinian Authority. This way he could tell the world Israel has no Palestinian partner and therefore it must occupy the West Bank forever. And now he is peddling to Israelis the fantasy that there are some perfect Palestinians who will step forward to run Gaza on Israel’s behalf and defy the only two Palestinian governing entities with any legitimacy — Hamas and Fatah. If you believe that, I have a bridge I’d like to sell you in Gaza. This will lead Israel, America’s primary Middle East ally, into a muddling, endlessly draining conflict. Hamas is not the Palestinian Authority. Hamas is a mass-murdering, Islamist, militant entity that has done more damage to Palestinians than any other organization. If Israel were to commit to working with a reforming Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza, freeze settlements and commit to developing a partnership with it for a Palestinian state one day, it would change everything. It would give Israel the global legitimacy to indeed dismantle Hamas, organize a Palestinian/Arab force that would govern Gaza so that neither Israel nor Hamas would and open the way for normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia. None of this would be easy or come with any assurance of success for the best-intended Israeli prime minister. But without at least an attempt — and another and another — Israel’s long-term survival is in peril. Unfortunately, Israel is led today by a man who is interested only in his short-term survival. And in that he is succeeding.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,11,1841,0.459,0.258,0.099,0.331,0.171,0.274,0.351,0.172,0.339,0.5,0.625
159,45422,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,Biden’s Real Mistake in Pausing Military Aid to Israel,"It is unfortunate that President Biden chose to announce his pause of some weapons sales to Israel while on a political campaign swing through Wisconsin. I use that word — “unfortunate” — not because I don’t understand why Biden did so, but because the move has enabled Benjamin Netanyahu to deflect attention from the fact that the most dangerous leader threatening Israel today is not Biden but Bibi. Netanyahu’s policies have not and will not produce a sustainable victory in Gaza, cannot secure Israel against its greatest existential threat — Iran — and are endangering world Jewry and undermining America’s broader Middle East strategic needs and goals. That is the real source of tension between Washington and Jerusalem today. It is not Biden’s temporary hold on sending Israel a fresh supply of 2,000-pound bombs and some other offensive weapons — which Biden has been warning Israel for months that he would do if Israel attempted to pulverize Rafah, the way that it did Gaza City and Khan Younis, without an evacuation of civilians. It is a measure of the level of contempt with which Netanyahu’s government views the Biden administration that Bibi’s minister of national security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, immediately posted on X about Biden’s move: “Hamas ?? Biden.” That is how Bibi’s team treats the most pro-Israel president in U.S. history, the man who rushed to save Israel from Hamas on Oct. 7 and from Iran on April 13. It is just shameful. Just do a simple mind experiment: Let’s assume Biden gave Israel all the 2,000-pound bombs it wanted. Israel leveled Rafah, where Hamas’s leadership, four intact battalions and many Israeli hostages are believed to be holed up. None of that would change the fact that Israel has no Palestinian or Arab partner to govern Gaza the next day in a way that would ensure a new Hamas would not rise from the ashes. Netanyahu has managed to persuade and cajole Israel’s army leadership and people to fight this war in Gaza for more than seven months with no plan for how to get out and consolidate whatever military victory has been achieved. This is a direct result of the fact that in December 2022, Netanyahu formed the most extreme, far-right cabinet in Israel’s history — to get back into power and stave off his trial on corruption charges. The Jewish supremacists in his cabinet will not let Netanyahu form any partnership with the non-Hamas Palestinian Authority that governs in the West Bank for fear it could lead to a Palestinian state there and in Gaza. That means the morning after any triumph over Hamas, Israel will either leave Gaza and have on its border some kind of gang-governed Somalia, where Hamas would most likely re-emerge under new leadership — as it has after Israel assassinated its previous generation of leaders — or Israel will find itself permanently occupying both Gaza and the West Bank, where it is already in charge. Together, about seven million Israeli Jews would be permanently controlling about five million Palestinian Arabs in two occupied territories, which would be a moral, economic and military overstretch that would delight Iran — because it would hasten Israel’s descent into being a global pariah. As Biden officials kept pressing Netanyahu on this, the answer they kept getting was the geopolitical equivalent of “just shut up and dribble” — that is, just keep sending us arms and using your credibility to defend us on the world stage, particularly at the United Nations. We’ll do whatever we want, consistent with Netanyahu’s political needs. Biden’s political needs and America’s geopolitical needs be damned. It’s a grave mistake to underestimate the danger the current Netanyahu government poses to Israel and its relationship with the United States and the world. Amos Harel, a veteran military correspondent for Haaretz, quoted a senior Israeli military commander on Friday, who summed up the situation better than I ever could: “The best way to harm Hamas now is by presenting a governmental alternative in Gaza. That’s not happening because the prime minister doesn’t want it. Every week, senior defense officials meet with foreign diplomats and generals. The repeated question is: What the blazes are you trying to achieve now? We don’t have a real answer for them.” Look at what is already happening as a result, Harel added. The Israeli Army has withdrawn so many of its troops from Gaza, save for the fresh units now surrounding Rafah and holding the central corridor dividing Gaza from north to south, that “Hamas is taking back governance in Gaza by every means,” Harel said. “Hamas’s efforts to restore governance also include the resumption of activity by the sharia courts, municipal services and sanitation departments in the municipalities.” If that is what winning looks like in the areas Israel has “liberated,” is it any wonder that Biden is wary of Israel leveling another Gazan city with no plan or partner for what comes next? That said, I thought it was a mistake for Biden to speak publicly for the first time about one of the most serious departures in U.S. foreign policy — pausing the transfer of some 3,500 bombs to Israel — in an off-the-cuff exchange with CNN’s Erin Burnett at a campaign stop. It left the impression that this was being done to satisfy the president’s left-wing base that opposes the war, and Republicans and some American Jewish leaders immediately pounced on him for it. If the president of the United States is going to discuss publicly for the first time something as serious as even a limited holdup of arms transfers to Israel, he needs to do it in a well-thought-out speech that puts all of this in context for Americans at home, for Israelis, for Israel’s friends and for Israel’s enemies. Such a speech would begin by making clear that if the U.S.-Israel alliance is under strain today, it’s because Israel has become a radically unstable partner under Netanyahu. He made a failed judicial coup his top priority for his first year in office — not dealing with Iran or the Palestinians. That divided Israeli society and distracted its military, probably tempting Hamas to think the time was right for an attack. This crazy lurch to the right in Israel — combined with a can’t-win strategy in Gaza combined with the fact that, as Harel wrote, “for almost a decade, Netanyahu purposefully wore down the civil service, weakened it and transferred the centers of power from the gatekeepers in the judiciary, treasury and defense establishment to a small group of” incompetent cronies — is hurting not only Israel’s interests but also America’s. For starters, the United States’ most advanced and vital military partner in the region is now bogged down in Gaza, with no apparent way out, straining American weapon reserves that are also needed by Ukraine. And an endless Gaza war can also destabilize other U.S. allies, particularly Jordan and Egypt. In addition, the United States is trying to forge a new security alliance with Saudi Arabia that would enable the Saudis to focus on what they most want to focus on right now — their economic development — without having to fear an attack from Iran. To help sell that deal to the American Congress, the Saudis agreed to normalize diplomatic relations with Israel — if Israel would embark on a pathway to a Palestinian state with a reformed Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. Netanyahu is refusing that condition and now the whole deal is up in the air. Last, as much damage as Hamas has done to Israel, Israel’s true existential threat is from Iran and its network of allies — Hezbollah, the Houthis, Hamas and Shiite militias in Iraq. On April 13, the United States pulled together an alliance with moderate Arab states, Britain and France to shoot down virtually all 300 of the drones and missiles Iran fired at Israel that night. The more Israel gets mired in Gaza and civilian deaths continue, it will get harder and harder for the moderate Arab states, particularly Jordan, to be seen as defending Israel from Iran. There is no question that Israel will be better off, Palestinians will be better off and the Middle East will be better off if Hamas is totally defeated. And if it takes Israel going into Rafah to do that, then so be it. Hamas invited this war. Many, many Palestinians in Gaza will feel liberated by its defeat — not only Israelis. But that is if and only if Israel partners with non-Hamas Palestinians to build a better Gaza and create the possibility of a new dawn for Palestinians and Israelis. Biden is justified in using U.S. leverage to insist that Israel operate with that goal in mind — because Israel’s prime minister is not.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,9,1469,0.18,0.078,0.24,0.099,0.115,0.166,0.119,0.191,0.094,0.5,0.5
160,45420,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,Why the Campus Protests Are So Troubling,"Readers have been asking me, and I have been asking myself of late, how I feel about the campus demonstrations to stop the war in Gaza. Anyone reading this column since Oct. 7 knows that my focus has been on events on the ground in the Middle East, but this phenomenon has become too big to ignore. In short: I find the whole thing very troubling, because the dominant messages from the loudest voices and many placards reject important truths about how this latest Gaza war started and what will be required to bring it to a fair and sustainable conclusion. My problem is not that the protests in general are “antisemitic” — I would not use that word to describe them, and indeed, I am deeply uncomfortable as a Jew with how the charge of antisemitism is thrown about on the Israel-Palestine issue. My problem is that I am a hardheaded pragmatist who lived in Beirut and Jerusalem, cares about people on all sides and knows one thing above all from my decades in the region: The only just and workable solution to this issue is two nation-states for two indigenous peoples. If you are for that, whatever your religion, nationality or politics, you’re part of the solution. If you are not for that, you’re part of the problem. And from everything I have read and watched, too many of these protests have become part of the problem — for three key reasons. First, they are virtually all about stopping Israel’s shameful behavior in killing so many Palestinian civilians in its pursuit of Hamas fighters, while giving a free pass to Hamas’s shameful breaking of the cease-fire that existed on Oct. 7. On that morning, Hamas launched an invasion in which it murdered Israeli parents in front of their children, children in front of their parents — documenting it on GoPro cameras — raped Israeli women and kidnapped or killed everyone they could get their hands on, from little kids to sick grandparents. Again, you can be — and should be — appalled at Israel’s response: bombing everything in its path in Gaza so disproportionately that thousands of children have been killed, maimed and orphaned. But if you refuse to acknowledge what Hamas did to trigger this — not to justify what Israel has done, but to explain how the Jewish state could inflict so much suffering on Palestinian men, women and children in reverse — you’re just another partisan throwing another partisan log on the fire. By giving Hamas a pass, the protests have put the onus on Israel to such a degree that its very existence is a target for some students, while Hamas’s murderous behavior is passed off as a praiseworthy adventure in decolonization. Second, when people chant slogans like “liberate Palestine” and “from the river to the sea,” they are essentially calling for the erasure of the state of Israel, not a two-state solution. They are arguing that the Jewish people have no right to self-determination or self-defense. I don’t believe that about Jews, and I don’t believe that about Palestinians. I believe in a two-state solution in which Israel, in return for security guarantees, withdraws from the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Arab areas of East Jerusalem, and a demilitarized Palestinian state that accepts the principle of two states for two peoples is established in those territories occupied in 1967. I believe in that so strongly that the thing I am most proud of in my 45-year career is my interview in February 2002 with the Saudi crown prince, Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz, in which he, for the first time, called on the entire Arab League to offer full peace and normalization of relations with Israel in exchange for full withdrawal to the 1967 lines — a call that led the Arab League to hold a peace conference the next month, on March 27 and 28, in Beirut to do just that. It was called the Arab Peace Initiative. And do you know what Hamas’s response was to that first pan-Arab peace initiative for a two-state solution? I’ll let CNN tell you. Here’s its report from Israel on the evening of March 27, 2002, right after the Arab League peace summit opened: NETANYA, Israel — A suicide bomber killed at least 19 people and injured 172 at a popular seaside hotel Wednesday, the start of the Jewish religious holiday of Passover. At least 48 of the injured were described as “severely wounded.” The bombing occurred in a crowded dining room at the Park Hotel, a coastal resort, during the traditional meal marking the start of Passover. … The Palestinian group Hamas, an Islamic fundamentalist group labeled a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department, claimed responsibility for the attack. Yes, that was Hamas’s response to the Arab peace initiative of two nation-states for two peoples: blowing up a Passover Seder in Israel. Hey, Friedman, but what about all the violence that Israeli settlers perpetrated against Palestinians and how Bibi Netanyahu deliberately built up Hamas and undermined the Palestinian Authority, which embraced Oslo? Answer: That violence and those Netanyahu actions are awful and harmful to a two-state solution as well. That is why I am intensely both anti-Hamas and anti-Netanyahu. And if you oppose just one and not also the other, you should reflect a little more on what you are shouting at your protest or your anti-protest. Because no one has done more to harm the prospects of a two-state solution than the codependent Hamas and Netanyahu factions. Hamas is not against the post-1967 occupation. It is against the existence of a Jewish state and believes there should be an Islamic state between the river and the sea. When protests on college campuses ignore that, they are part of the problem. Just as much as Israel supporters who ignore the fact that the far-right members in Netanyahu’s own coalition government are for a Jewish state from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea. How do I know? Because Netanyahu wrote it into the coalition agreement between himself and his far-right partners. The third reason that these protests have become part of the problem is that they ignore the view of many Palestinians in Gaza who detest Hamas’s autocracy. These Palestinians are enraged by precisely what these student demonstrations ignore: Hamas launched this war without permission from the Gazan population and without preparation for Gazans to protect themselves when Hamas knew that a brutal Israeli response would follow. In fact, a Hamas official said at the start of the war that its tunnels were for only its fighters, not civilians. That is not to excuse Israel in the least for its excesses, but, again, it is also not to give Hamas a pass for inviting them. My view: Hamas was ready to sacrifice thousands of Gazan civilians to win the support of the next global generation on TikTok. And it worked. But one reason it worked was a lack of critical thinking by too many in that generation — the result of a campus culture that has become way too much about what to think and not how to think. I highly recommend a few different articles about how angry Gazans are at Hamas for starting this war without any goal in mind other than the fruitless task of trying to destroy Israel so Hamas’s leader, Yahya Sinwar, could get his personal revenge. I was particularly struck by a piece in The National, a newspaper in Abu Dhabi, by Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, a Palestinian American raised in Gaza. The headline is: “Israel’s War Has Killed 31 Members of My Family, Yet It’s Vital to Speak Out Against Hamas.” Alkhatib placed Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack in the context of the rising protests against its inept and autocrat rule that have broken out periodically in Gaza since 2019, under the banner of “We Want to Live.” Wrote Alkhatib, a political analyst who is a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council: “Having grown up in Gaza, I experienced Hamas’s rise to power and their gradual grip over the Strip and Palestinian politics and society, hiding behind a resistance narrative and using extremist politics to sabotage prospects for a peaceful resolution to the conflict with Israel. Months before Oct. 7, tens of thousands of Gazans protested in the streets in defiance of Hamas, just as they had in 2019 and 2017.” Alkhatib added that the “‘We Want to Live’ protest movement decried living conditions and unemployment in Gaza, as well as the lack of a political horizon for meaningful change in the territory’s realities and opportunities. Hamas’s regime consisted of a criminal and despotic enterprise that used Gaza as a haven for the group’s members and affiliates and turned Palestinians there into aid-dependent subjects reliant on the international community” and turned Gaza into “a ‘resistance citadel’ that was part of a nefarious regional alliance with Iran.” A campus with critical thinkers might have had a teach-in on the central lawn on that subject, not just on the violence of Israeli settlers. Against this backdrop, we are seeing college presidents at places like Rutgers and Northwestern agree to some of the demands by students to end their protests. As NPR summarized them, the “demands vary by school, though they generally call for an end to the Israel-Hamas war, disclosures of institutional investments and divestment from companies with ties to Israel or that otherwise profit from its military operation in Gaza.” What Palestinians and Israelis need most now are not performative gestures of disinvestment but real gestures of impactful investment, not the threat of a deeper war in Rafah but a way to build more partners for peace. Invest in groups that promote Arab-Jewish understanding, like the Abraham Initiatives or the New Israel Fund. Invest in management skills capacity-building for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, like the wonderful Education for Employment network or Anera, that will help a new generation to take over the Palestinian Authority and build strong, noncorrupt institutions to run a Palestinian state. This is not a time for exclusionary thinking. It is a time for complexity thinking and pragmatic thinking: How do we get to two nation-states for two indigenous peoples? If you want to make a difference and not just make a point, stand for that, work for that, reject anyone who rejects it and give a hug to anyone who embraces it.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,7,1740,0.045,0.275,0.725,0.077,0.081,0.081,0.104,0.168,0.125,0.5,0.5
161,45414,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,Israel and Saudi Arabia Are Trading Places,"Saudi Arabia and Israel are America’s two most important Middle East allies, and the Biden administration is deeply involved with both today, trying to forge a mutual defense treaty with Saudi Arabia and help Israel in its conflicts with Hamas and Iran. But the Biden team has run into an unprecedented situation with these two longtime partners that is creating a huge opportunity and a huge danger for America. It derives from the contrast in their internal politics. To put it bluntly, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has put his country’s worst religious extremists in jail, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has put his country’s worst religious extremists in his cabinet. And therein lies a tale. M.B.S., with his laser focus on economic growth after several decades that he has described Saudi Arabia as having been “sleeping,” has unleashed the most important social revolution ever in the desert kingdom — and one that is sending shock waves around the Arab world. It has reached a point where the U.S. and Saudi Arabia are now putting the finishing touches on a formal alliance that could isolate Iran, curb China’s influence in the Middle East and peacefully inspire more positive change in this region than the U.S. invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan ever did militarily. M.B.S.’s government did something appalling when it killed Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a liberal critic living in the United States, in Istanbul in 2018. M.B.S. has also done something none of his predecessors dared: break the stranglehold that the most conservative Islamists held over Saudi social and religious policy since 1979. This shift has proved so popular among so many Saudi women and young people that women’s participation in the work force jumped to 35 percent from 20 percent between 2018 and 2022, according to a report by the Atlantic Council, and is even higher today. That is one of the most rapid social changes anywhere in the world. In Riyadh, you see its impact on the city’s streets, in its coffeehouses and in government and business offices. Saudi women aren’t just driving cars; they are driving change, in the diplomatic corps, in the biggest banks and in the recent Saudi women’s premier soccer league. M.B.S.’s radical new vision for his country is nowhere more manifest than in his publicly stated willingness to normalize diplomatic and economic relations with the Jewish state as part of a new mutual defense pact with the United States. The crown prince wants as peaceful a region as possible, and a Saudi Arabia as secure from Iran as possible, so he can focus on making Saudi Arabia a diversified economic powerhouse. That used to be Israel too. Alas, the tragedy of Israel under Netanyahu is that because he has been so desperate to gain and hold power to avoid possible jail time on corruption charges, he has created a governing coalition that has given unprecedented power to two far-right Jewish supremacists with authority in three ministries — defense, finance and national security — and prioritized a judicial coup before it did anything else. Netanyahu has also made unparalleled concessions to ultra-Orthodox rabbis, transferring enormous sums of money to their schools that often don’t teach math, English or civics and most of whose draft-age men refuse to serve in the army at all, let alone alongside women. Of course, Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy and Israel is a democracy. M.B.S. can order changes that no Israeli prime minister can. Still, leaders in both have to gauge what will enable them to stay in power, and those instincts are driving Netanyahu to make Israel more like the worst of the old Saudi Arabia and M.B.S. to make Saudi Arabia more like the best of the old Israel. The result of Netanyahu’s alliance with the far right is that Israel can’t take advantage of the tectonic shift in Saudi Arabia — with its offer to normalize relations with the Jewish state and open a road for Israel with the rest of the Muslim world — because doing so would require Israel to pursue a pathway with Palestinians to create two states for two indigenous peoples. Moreover, without offering some horizon for a two-state solution with non-Hamas Palestinians, Israel can’t forge a permanent security alliance with the coalition of moderate Arab states that helped thwart the barrage of more than 300 drones and missiles that Iran fired at Israel on April 13 in response to Israel’s killing of a senior Iranian military commander and some of his subordinates in Syria. Those Arab states cannot afford to appear to be defending Israel indefinitely if Israel is not working to find moderate Palestinian partners to replace Israel’s control over Gaza and the West Bank. In other words, Israel today cannot summon the coalitions it needs to thrive as a nation, because it would lead to the breakup of the governing coalition that Netanyahu needs to survive as a politician. All of this is creating a huge headache for President Biden, who has done more to save the Israeli people from Hamas and Iran than any other American president but has been frustrated by an Israeli prime minister who is more interested in saving himself. Biden’s support for Netanyahu is now costing him politically and curtailing his ability to take full advantage of the changes in the Arabian Peninsula. It could also cost him re-election. Since M.B.S. began dominating Saudi decision-making in 2016 — in the place of his ailing father, King Salman, Saudi Arabia has basically gone from an incubator of A.Q. — Al Qaeda — to an incubator of A.I. Indeed, there is a lot of trouble these days between the two most reform-minded leaders in the Arab world: M.B.S. and M.B.Z., Mohammed bin Zayed, the ruler of the United Arab Emirates. But it is good trouble. It is an intense competition over who can partner fastest and deepest with the most important global companies driving A.I. As the U.A.E.’s most important newspaper, The National, noted on Tuesday: “In the aftermath of Microsoft’s $1.5 billion investment in Abu Dhabi artificial intelligence and cloud company G42, the spotlight is now on the Middle East’s growing stature as a regional leader for global technology. The charge, led by the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia, has attracted attention from the likes of Oracle, Google and Amazon and highlights increasing investor confidence in the region, with growing financial backing from, and relations with, the West.” It is impossible to overstate the power of a nearby good example. When M.B.S. announced in 2018 that Saudi women could attend sporting events like men’s soccer games, Iranian women demanded the same from their ayatollahs. The ayatollahs were forced to relent after a 29-year-old Iranian woman charged with trying to attend a men’s soccer match died in September 2019 after setting herself on fire. As one young Saudi official recently remarked to me, M.B.S. was able to sideline the religious extremists in the kingdom, without starting a civil war, by unleashing all the pent-up energy of young Saudis, who wanted to realize their full potential by being connected with all the cutting-edge global trends. So these youths just steamrolled the resistance from the roughly 30 percent of Saudis whom I’d describe as hyperconservative. (Saudi sources tell me that about 500 of the most extreme clerics have been locked up. M.B.S. is wisely still paying other very conservative government religious officials, like the religious police, but he has disempowered them — not without personal risk to himself.) Iran, by contrast, has unleashed the full brutality of its religious authorities to steamroll Iranian youths, who went into open civil war with the regime in September 2022 after an Iranian woman named Mahsa Amini died in police custody. She had been arrested for allegedly not properly covering herself in public. That is why you get scenes like Iranian college students in 2020 refusing to walk on American and Israeli flags that the clerics painted on the ground at the gateways to their universities, or in April booing and honking horns at a soccer match when the regime demanded a moment of silence in honor of the Iranian military commanders killed by Israel. They see Iran’s religious dictators exploiting the Palestinian cause and Hamas to cover the Iranian Revolutionary Guards’ brutality against Iran’s own youth. This is in stark contrast with some of the U.S. college students now demonstrating who see Israel as the “colonial” aggressor and give Hamas a free pass, even though it murdered, kidnapped and raped Israelis on Oct. 7, triggering the massive Israeli bombardments that have killed tens of thousands of Gazan civilians, including thousands of children, with seeming indifference. The key question for the Biden administration and the Saudis today is this: What to do next? The good news is that they are 90 percent done with the mutual defense treaty that they have drawn up, both sides tell me. But they still need to tie down a few key points. These include the precise ways in which the U.S. will control the civilian nuclear energy program that Saudi Arabia will get under the deal; whether the mutual defense component will be explicit, like that between the U.S. and Japan, or less formal, like the understanding between the U.S. and Taiwan; and a long-term commitment for Saudi Arabia to continue to price oil in U.S. dollars, not switch to the Chinese currency. But the other part of the deal, which is seen as critical to winning support in Congress, is for Saudi Arabia to normalize relations with Israel. That will happen only if Israel agrees to Riyadh’s terms: get out of Gaza, freeze the building of settlements in the West Bank and embark on a three- to five-year “pathway” to establish a Palestinian state in the occupied territories. That state would also be conditioned on the Palestinian Authority undertaking reforms to make it a governing body that Palestinians trust and see as legitimate and Israelis see as effective. There are a lot of “ifs” and “provided thats” in this equation that seem most unlikely today. They might seem less so when the Gaza war ends and both Israelis and Palestinians add up the terrible costs of not having a permanent peaceful solution and contemplate whether they want more of the same or to make a radical departure. It is clear to U.S. and Saudi officials that with Netanyahu having thrown in with the far right to stay in power, he’s highly unlikely to agree to any kind of Palestinian statehood that would lead his partners to topple him — unless his political survival dictates otherwise. As a result, the U.S. and the Saudis are considering finalizing the deal and taking it to Congress with the stated proviso that Saudi Arabia will normalize relations with Israel the minute Israel has a government ready to meet the Saudi-U.S. terms. But no decision has been made. U.S. officials know that Israel is in such turmoil today, and with the whole world seemingly coming down on it, it is impossible to really get Israelis to consider the profound long-term political and economic benefits of normalized relations with Saudi Arabia, the world’s most influential Muslim nation and Arab nation. Hopefully, though, if there can be a permanent end of fighting and a return of all Israelis taken hostage, Israel will hold new elections. And then — maybe, just maybe — the choice on the table for Israelis will not be Bibi or Bibi-lite, but Bibi or a credible pathway to peace with Saudi Arabia and the Palestinians.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,7,1930,0.367,0.623,0.294,0.092,0.538,0.531,0.521,0.211,0.243,0.5,0.5
162,45408,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,Israel Has a Choice to Make: Rafah or Riyadh,"U.S. diplomacy to end the Gaza war and forge a new relationship with Saudi Arabia has been converging in recent weeks into a single giant choice for Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: What do you want more — Rafah or Riyadh? Do you want to mount a full-scale invasion of Rafah to try to finish off Hamas — if that is even possible — without offering any Israeli exit strategy from Gaza or any political horizon for a two-state solution with non-Hamas-led Palestinians? If you go this route, it will only compound Israel’s global isolation and force a real breach with the Biden administration. Or do you want normalization with Saudi Arabia, an Arab peacekeeping force for Gaza and a U.S.-led security alliance against Iran? This would come with a different price: a commitment from your government to work toward a Palestinian state with a reformed Palestinian Authority — but with the benefit of embedding Israel in the widest U.S.-Arab-Israeli defense coalition the Jewish state has ever enjoyed and the biggest bridge to the rest of the Muslim world Israel has ever been offered while creating at least some hope that the conflict with the Palestinians will not be a “forever war.” This is one of the most fateful choices Israel has ever had to make. And what I find both disturbing and depressing is that there is no major Israeli leader today in the ruling coalition, the opposition or the military who is consistently helping Israelis understand that choice — a global pariah or a Middle East partner — or explaining why it should choose the second. I appreciate how traumatized Israelis are by the vicious Hamas murders, rapes and kidnappings of Oct. 7. It is not surprising to me that many people there just want revenge, and their hearts have hardened to a degree that they can’t see or care about all of the civilians, including thousands of children, who have been killed in Gaza as Israel has plowed through to try to eliminate Hamas. All of this has been further hardened by Hamas’s refusal so far to release the remaining hostages. But revenge is not a strategy. It is pure insanity that Israel is now more than six months into this war and the Israeli military leadership — and virtually the entire political class — has allowed Netanyahu to continue to pursue a “total victory” there, including probably soon plunging deep into Rafah, without any exit plan or Arab partner lined up to step in once the war ends. If Israel ends up with an indefinite occupation of both Gaza and the West Bank, it would be a toxic military, economic and moral overstretch that would delight Israel’s most dangerous foe, Iran, and repel all its allies in the West and the Arab world. Early in the war, Israeli military and political leaders would tell you that moderate Arab leaders wanted Israel to wipe out Hamas, an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that is detested by every Arab monarch. Sure, they would have liked Hamas gone — if it could have been done in a few weeks with few civilian casualties. It’s now clear that it can’t be, and prolonging the war is not in the interest of the moderate Arab states, particularly Saudi Arabia. From the conversations I’ve been having here in Riyadh and in Washington, I’d describe Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s view of the Israeli invasion of Gaza today like this: Get out as soon as possible. All Israel is doing at this point is killing more and more civilians, turning Saudis who favored normalization with Israel against it, creating more recruits for Al Qaeda and ISIS, empowering Iran and its allies, fomenting instability and driving away much-needed foreign investment from this region. The idea of wiping out Hamas “once and for all” is a pipe dream, in the Saudi view. If Israel wants to continue to do special operations in Gaza to get the leadership, no problem. But no boots permanently on the ground. Please get to a full cease-fire and hostage release as soon as possible and focus instead on the U.S.-Saudi-Israeli-Palestinian security-normalization deal. That is the other road that Israel could take right now — the one that no major Israeli opposition leader is arguing for as the top priority, but the one that the Biden administration and the Saudis, Egyptians, Jordanians, Bahrainis, Moroccans and Emiratis are rooting for. Its success is by no means a sure thing, but neither is the “total victory” that Netanyahu is promising. This other road starts with Israel forgoing any total military invasion of Rafah, which is right up against the border with Egypt and is the main route through which humanitarian relief enters Gaza by trucks. The area is home to more than 200,000 permanent residents and now also more than one million refugees from northern Gaza. It is also where the last four most intact Hamas battalions are said to be dug in and, maybe, its leader Yahya Sinwar. The Biden administration has been telling Netanyahu publicly that he must not engage in a full-scale invasion of Rafah without a credible plan to get those one million-plus civilians out of the way — and that Israel has yet to present such a plan. But privately they are being more blunt and telling Israel: No massive invasion of Rafah, period. A senior U.S. official put it to me this way: “We are not saying to Israel just leave Hamas be. We are saying that we believe there is a more targeted way to go after the leadership, without leveling Rafah block by block.” The Biden team, he insisted, is not trying to spare the Hamas bosses — just spare Gaza another spasm of mass civilian losses. Let’s remember, the official added, that Israel thought Hamas’s leaders were in Khan Yunis and it destroyed much of that town looking for them and not finding them. And they did the same with Gaza City in the north. What happened? Sure, a lot of Hamas fighters there were killed, but many others just dissolved into the ruins and have now popped up anew — so much so that a Hamas unit on April 18 was able to fire a rocket from Beit Lahia in northern Gaza toward the Israeli city of Ashkelon. U.S. officials are convinced that if Israel now smashes up all of Rafah, after having done the same to big parts of Khan Yunis and Gaza City, and has no credible Palestinian partner to relieve it of the security burden of governing a broken Gaza, it will be making the kind of mistake the United States made in Iraq and end up dealing with a permanent insurgency on top of a permanent humanitarian crisis. But there would be one critical difference: The United States is a superpower that could fail in Iraq and bounce back. For Israel, a permanent Gaza insurgency would be crippling, especially with no friends left. And that is why U.S. officials tell me that if Israel does mount a major military operation in Rafah, over the administration’s objections, President Biden would consider restricting certain arms sales to Israel. This is not only because the Biden administration wants to avoid more civilian casualties in Gaza out of humanitarian concerns or because they would further inflame global public opinion against Israel and make it even more difficult for the Biden team to defend Israel. It’s because the administration believes that a full-scale Israeli invasion of Rafah will both undermine prospects for a new hostage exchange, for which officials say there are now some fresh glimmers of hope, and destroy three vital projects it has been working on to enhance Israel’s long-term security. The first is an Arab peacekeeping force that could replace Israeli troops in Gaza, so that Israel can get out and not be stuck occupying both Gaza and the West Bank forever. Several Arab states have been discussing sending peacekeeping troops to Gaza to replace Israeli troops, who would have to leave — provided there is a permanent cease-fire — and the presence of the troops would be formally blessed by a joint decision of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the umbrella body bringing together most Palestinian factions, and the Palestinian Authority. The Arab states would also most likely insist on some U.S. military logistical assistance. Nothing has been decided yet, but the idea is under active consideration. The second is the U.S.-Saudi-Israeli-Palestinian diplomatic-security deal that the administration is close to finalizing the terms of with the Saudi crown prince. It has several components, but the three key U.S.-Saudi ones are: 1) A mutual defense pact between the United States and Saudi Arabia that would take any ambiguity out of what America would do if Iran attacked Saudi Arabia. The United States would come to Riyadh’s defense, and vice versa. 2) Streamlining Saudi access to the most advanced U.S. weapons. 3) A tightly controlled civilian nuclear deal that would allow Saudi Arabia to take advantage of its own uranium deposits for use in its own civilian nuclear reactor. In return, the Saudis would curb Chinese investment inside Saudi Arabia as well as any military ties and build its next-generation defense systems entirely with U.S. weaponry, which would be a boon for American defense manufacturers and make the two armies entirely interoperable. The Saudis, with their abundant cheap energy and physical space, would like to host some of the massive data-processing centers required by U.S. tech companies to exploit artificial intelligence, at a time when domestic U.S. energy costs and physical space are becoming so scarce that new data centers are becoming harder and harder to build at home. Saudi Arabia would also normalize relations with Israel, provided that Netanyahu committed to work toward a two-state solution with an overhauled Palestinian Authority. And last, the United States would bring together Israel, Saudi Arabia, other moderate Arab states and key European allies into a single, integrated security architecture to counter Iranian missile threats the way they did on an ad hoc basis when Iran attacked Israel on April 13 in retaliation for an Israeli strike on some senior Iranian military leaders suspected of running operations against Israel, who were meeting at an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria. This coalition will not come together on any continued basis without Israel getting out of Gaza and committing to work toward Palestinian statehood. There is no way Arab states can be seen to be permanently protecting Israel from Iran if Israel is permanently occupying Gaza and the West Bank. U.S. and Saudi officials also know that without Israel in the deal, the U.S.-Saudi security components are not likely to ever get through Congress. The Biden team wants to complete the U.S.-Saudi part of the deal so that it can act like the opposition party that Israel does not have right now and be able to say to Netanyahu: You can be remembered as the leader who presided over Israel’s worst military catastrophe on Oct. 7 or the leader who led Israel out of Gaza and opened the road to normalization between Israel and the most important Muslim state. Your choice. And it wants to offer this choice publicly so that every Israeli can see it. So let me end where I began: Israel’s long-term interests are in Riyadh, not Rafah. Of course, neither is a sure thing and both come with risks. And I know that it’s not so easy for Israelis to weigh them when so many global protesters these days are hammering Israel for its bad behavior in Gaza and giving Hamas a free pass. But that’s what leaders are for: to make the case that the road to Riyadh has a much bigger payoff at the end than the road to Rafah, which will be a dead end in every sense of the term. I totally respect that Israelis are the ones who will have to live with the choice. I just want to make sure they know they have one.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,9,2008,0.452,0.396,0.307,0.258,0.5,0.098,0.415,0.551,0.404,0.5,0.5
163,45398,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,"How to Be Pro-Palestinian, Pro-Israeli and Pro-Iranian","Iran’s missile and drone attack on Israel over the weekend was a game-changing escalation that requires some game-changing rethinking on the part of Israel and its most important ally, the United States. I call it “the three-state solution.” It begins with the recognition that there is probably zero hope for any resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or the Israel-Iran conflict without leadership change in Tehran, Jerusalem and Ramallah. Starting with Tehran: I don’t favor any Western attempt to topple the Islamic Republic of Iran from outside, but I pray that one day the Iranian people will do so from inside. “This region won’t see any meaningful peace or stability so long as this current government is in power in Tehran,” explained Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Because Iran’s vast resources and training are funding the 5 percent of fanatics who are making life hell for the 95 percent of Palestinians, Lebanese, Syrians, Yemenis and Iraqis who just want to live in peace. To paraphrase Shimon Peres about prospects for change in Iran, the good news is there is light at the end of that tunnel. The bad news is that today there is no tunnel.” Given how many times Iranians have challenged their theocratic regime only to be crushed by its iron fist, it’s clear that there is a will. We just have to hope they find a way one day soon. Because Iran and Israel once were natural allies — the two major non-Arab powers in the Middle East. That changed with the Islamic revolution in 1979. It put in place in Tehran a regime that prioritized spreading its Islamic ideology — and the destruction of the Jewish state of Israel — over the welfare of Iranians. If Iran were just a normal state prioritizing the advance of its own people over the destruction of another, it would be a huge change for the region. It was good to see that the Tehran regime did not get much of a popularity boost in the region from firing over 300 drones and missiles at Israel on Saturday — almost all of which were intercepted or crashed before doing any damage. In fact, social media accounts in the Arab world have been rife with jokes ridiculing the Iranian regime for basically being 0-for-300, and suggesting that the only people who died did so from laughter. When I say we need regime change in Ramallah, I am referring to the corrupt and inept Palestinian Authority, led by the 88-year-old Mahmoud Abbas. Why is the Palestinian Authority so important? Because it still embraces living in peace with Israel and the Oslo framework meant to lead to two states for two indigenous peoples. That is what makes a strong Palestinian Authority the keystone of any Israeli-Palestinian peace and of sustainable Arab-Israeli-Western alliance to deter or confront Iran. So if you want to be pro-Palestinian today — as well as pro-Israel, pro-U.S.-Saudi-Israel agreement, pro-Abraham Accords, or anti-Iranian regime — the single most meaningful thing you can push for, demonstrate for or volunteer to contribute to is the transformation of the Palestinian Authority into a professionally led, noncorrupt, accountable-to-donors, effective governing institution. That kind of Palestinian Authority can be a partner for a two-state solution with Israel and replace Israeli forces, along with friendly Arab armies, and govern Gaza in place of the pro-Iranian, Israel-hating Hamas — if it can be dismantled. I give the Biden team generally high marks for the job that it has done responding to the hugely fraught and complex Gaza war — and, over the weekend, helping Israel deal with the Iranian missile attack. One key mistake it has made, though, was staying passive as President Abbas appointed a “new” government led by a longtime crony as prime minister, the businessman Muhammad Mustafa, in March. That was not the government of change that many Palestinians were hoping for, that the moderate Arabs were demanding and that the Palestinian people so badly needed. As anyone who has reported from the West Bank knows, there is abundant leadership talent among Palestinians there, not to mention abroad — highly educated and able men and women. But too few have been tapped for the Palestinian Authority, which needs to have the best and the brightest of Palestinians at this key moment. Countries like the United Arab Emirates are ready to come in and advise, train and fund a transforming Palestinian Authority, and even stand alongside it in Gaza with armed forces, but that is not going to happen until President Abbas retires. The authority needs a proven, noncorrupt institution builder in the mold of former Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, the best Palestinian leadership role model ever. Which leads to why we need leadership change in Israel today, too. No one has done more to frustrate and prevent the emergence of an effective Palestinian Authority than Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who spent years making sure that Hamas had enough resources from Qatar to stay in power in Gaza, and prevent any unified Palestinian decision-making body — while, at the same time, denigrating the Palestinian Authority for every fault it had. Netanyahu never praised the authority for sticking to nonviolence (unlike Hamas) and for the way its security services helped Israel keep the West Bank from exploding despite the huge expansion of Israeli settlements. Netanyahu’s approach was shameful and, we now see, not in Israel’s interest. A lot of Palestinians, and their supporters abroad, are saying today, “Well, if Israel says there is no difference between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas, maybe we should all just be with Hamas.” How is that in Israel’s interest? Moreover, last October, Israel invaded Gaza under Netanyahu’s leadership with no exit strategy, no plan for the morning after and no Palestinian partner that can govern Gaza, along with friendly Arab armies, if Israel can bring down the Hamas government. Netanyahu will not partner with the Palestinian Authority because he is on trial for corruption and needs to hold onto his office to plea bargain, in the event of any conviction. The only way he can do that is to rely on far-right Jewish supremacist/settler parties in his coalition, which refuse to see the Palestinian Authority become an effective governing body because that would mean it is a legitimate partner for a two-state solution that would force Israel to relinquish all or part of the West Bank. This is not only incredibly dangerous for Israel in terms of the future of Gaza, but also — one can now clearly see — for the confrontation with Iran, which is going to a whole new level. Israel, as was demonstrated over the weekend, could not have effectively dealt with Iran’s missile attack without a regional alliance — without tight coordination with Jordan and Arab Gulf states, which provided both early warning detection and, in the case of Jordan, actually shot down Iranian missiles and drones heading for Israel. Israel also relied on the help of the U.S., British and French Air Forces, and the U.S. Navy. Attention, attention, attention: It is a complete fantasy to believe that the U.S., Jordan, and Israel’s Arab and NATO allies will be able to maintain a long confrontation with Iran — openly defending Israel — if Israel has a government determined to annex the West Bank and populate every sector there with settlements as well as remain in Gaza without any legitimate Palestinian partner. Israel’s popularity has been eroding across the Western world since Oct. 7 — not to mention the Arab Muslim world. The support Israel garnered last weekend against Iran is not sustainable, unless Israel evinces a changed attitude toward the Palestinian Authority and plans a way out of Gaza. But let’s fantasize in a different direction for a moment. Imagine if Israel tomorrow announced a freeze on new settlements, a willingness to transfer more governing and security responsibilities to the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Gaza — as soon as it has built the capacity — and a willingness to invite in the U.S., the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia to help bring the Palestinian Authority up to that level and fund its institutions, what would immediately happen? Both Iran and Hamas would be deflated — more than any Israeli missile strike could accomplish. “Oh my God,” the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and Hamas would say, “that is a disaster. It means we cannot continue to easily delegitimize Israel in the West. It means conditions have been created for the U.S.-Israeli-Palestinian-Saudi security treaty. And it means the Arab governments will be able to much more comfortably and openly collaborate with Israel against Iran and its proxies. That is a disaster.” It would also mean that Iran would no longer be able to pose as the great defender of the Palestinian cause — a pose that simply disguises its venomous desire to destroy the Jewish state and deflects attention from its crushing of its own people, particularly women and girls, and their democratic aspirations. At the same time, in America and Western capitals, collaboration with Israel would no longer be so politically toxic. And in Moscow and Beijing, their collaboration with Iran would look as cynical as it is — pro-Hamas, not pro-Palestinian. Yes, I can assure you: Nothing could be more to Israel’s strategic benefit. But it cannot and will not happen as long as Netanyahu is in power. We are in a chaotic moment in the Middle East right now. All I know for certain is that an effective, credible, legitimate Palestinian Authority is the keystone for every decent outcome — a sustainable two-state solution, a sustainable Arab-Israeli alliance against Iran, a sustainable U.S. and NATO Middle East policy to protect a democratic Israel from theocratic Tehran and a sustainable removal of the “Palestine card” from Iran’s hands. But it will take leadership transformations in Tehran, Ramallah and Jerusalem (and not Washington) to happen.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,7,1659,0.568,0.278,0.216,0.076,0.5,0.379,0.268,0.316,0.52,0.5,0.5
164,45396,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,Iran Just Made a Big Mistake. Israel Shouldn’t Follow.,"It would be easy to be dazzled by the way Israeli, American and other allied militaries shot down virtually every Iranian drone, cruise missile and ballistic missile launched at Israel on Saturday and conclude that Iran had made its point — retaliating for Israel’s allegedly killing a top Iranian commander operating against Israel from Syria — and now we can call it a day. That would be a dangerous misreading of what just happened and a huge geopolitical mistake by the West and the world at large. There now needs to be a massive, sustained, global initiative to isolate Iran — not only to deter it from trying such an adventure again but also to give reason to Israel not to automatically retaliate militarily. That would be a grievous error, too. Iran has a regional network, and Israel needs a regional alliance, along with the U.S., to deter it over the long run. So there must be major diplomatic and economic consequences for Iran, with countries like China finally stepping up: When Tehran fired all those drones and missiles, it could not know that virtually all of them would be intercepted. Some were shot down over Jerusalem. A missile could have hit al-Aqsa Mosque, one of Islam’s holiest shrines. (You can see pictures online of Iranian rockets being intercepted in the skies right over the mosque.) Another could have hit the Israeli Parliament or a high-rise apartment house, causing massive casualties. In other words, we are talking about an escalation without precedent in the long-running, tightly contained, shadow war between Iran and Israel that had almost exclusively been limited to targeted Israeli strikes against Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps units in Lebanon and Syria — where they have no business being in the first place — and Iran retaliating by having its Lebanese proxy militia, Hezbollah, fire rockets at Israel. We’ve also seen Iran smuggling arms and explosives from Syria into Jordan, Gaza and the West Bank to be used to kill Israelis and destabilize Jordan — and the Mossad assassinating a nuclear scientist inside Iran. But Israel has never launched such a massive missile strike directly at Iran, and Iran had never done so to Israel, either, before this. Indeed, no country had attacked Israel directly since Saddam Hussein’s Iraq did with Scud missiles 33 years ago. Without a U.S.-led global initiative to impose sanctions on Iran and further isolate it on the world stage, Iran’s behavior would be tacitly normalized, in which case Israel will most likely retaliate in kind and we’re on our way to a major Middle East war and $250-a-barrel oil. “The alternative to a wider full-scale regional war, which we don’t want and Israel doesn’t want, cannot be a return to the status quo ante,” Nader Mousavizadeh, the founder and C.E.O. of the geopolitical consulting firm Macro Advisory Partners and a senior adviser to Kofi Annan when he was the U.N. secretary general, told me. A global effort to isolate Iran, Mousavizadeh added, “is the best way to separate the regime from its people, reassure Israel and Israelis of their security and remove the need for further regional military escalation, which would be a gift to Iran and its proxies.” It is also the best way to ensure that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel does not drag the United States into a regional war to shore up his own crumbling political base. It is impossible to exaggerate the political-military implications of what just happened. Shortly after the missile strike, President Ebrahim Raisi of Iran issued a statement declaring that the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps had “taught a lesson to the Zionist enemy.” It sure did, but it may not be the one Raisi thinks. Iran just unwittingly revealed to the whole world that Iran’s government is so penetrated by Western espionage agencies (because so many Iranians hate their own government) that President Biden was able to predict almost the exact hour of attack over a day in advance, and it showed the whole world that Israel and its Western allies have far superior antimissile capabilities than Iran has missile capabilities. As the Haaretz veteran military correspondent Amos Harel wrote Sunday: We are talking about “an unprecedented achievement in the history of Israel’s wars — albeit with some help from friends — that largely takes away the main card held by Iran and the axis: drones and missiles. The impressive Arrow system interceptions have garnered most of the attention, but Israeli and American pilots downed hundreds of cruise missiles and drones.” One has to assume that Iran and its proxies have to be both disappointed and unnerved by this turn of events. As Harel added: “The Iranian intention, as evaluated ahead of the attack, was to put on a display of its capabilities with an attack on military targets. An analysis of the areas in which warnings were sounded suggests the target could have been the Nevatim air base in southern Israel. It appears that the Iranians planned to destroy the base and the advanced F-35 fighter jets stationed there, which are the crown jewel of American aid to Israel. Iran failed completely.” Instead, the Iranian attack may have been limited to badly wounding a 7-year-old Israeli Muslim Bedouin girl hit by falling shrapnel. And if that’s how effective Iran’s offense was, its leaders have to now be wondering how good its defenses are — if Israel now chooses to retaliate. Hezbollah has to be asking the same. That may explain why Raisi, after his boast about teaching Israel a lesson, asked (pleaded?) that the U.S. and all other “supporters of the occupying regime … appreciate this responsible and proportionate action by the Islamic Republic of Iran” and not go on the offensive against Iran. Message to the world from Tehran: We were just sending a little warning shot, nothing to worry about here, let’s move on.  That is not only because Raisi is worried about his external front. Early this month, Haaretz reported that “Iranian soccer fans in Tehran’s Aryamehr Stadium were asked to observe a minute of silence in honor of the seven members of Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards, including top general Mohammad Reza Zahedi, who were killed in [the Israeli] airstrike on its consulate in Damascus. Instead, spectators began booing and blowing air horns in an apparent act of protest. In a video circulating on social media, fans can be seen loudly interrupting the moment of silence. … In one video that made the rounds on X, fans can be seen shouting, ‘Take that Palestinian flag and shove it up your ass!’” And this is not the first time it’s happened at football matches. Many Iranians understand that the regime’s obsession with destroying the Jewish state is nothing but a costly way to divert the Iranian public’s attention from its murderous crackdown at home against its own people. As this soccer match story indicates, people are growing less afraid to say so in public — especially after the regime has killed an estimated 750 women, girls and men since a nationwide protest uprising started on Sept. 16, 2022, after the death of a young Kurdish woman, Mahsa Amini, in the custody of Iran’s morality police. Thousands more have been arrested. One reason Iran supports the Hamas war and prefers that Israel remain stuck in Gaza and occupying the West Bank is that it keeps the world and many Americans focused on Israeli actions — rather than on the brutal crackdown against democracy protesters in Iran and on Iran’s imperialist influence in the region, where it uses proxies to control the politics of Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen and uses those countries as military bases to attack Israel. No one should think Iran is just a paper tiger. Tehran can still unleash thousands of shorter-range rockets against Israel through Hezbollah — and because some of these rockets have precision guidance, they could do significant damage to Israel’s infrastructure. Iran has bigger missiles in its arsenal, as well. Still, what happened Saturday is ultimately a significant boost for what I call the Inclusion Network in the Middle East (more open, connected countries like Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Israel and the NATO allies) and a real setback for the Resistance Network (the closed and autocratic systems represented by Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and Iran’s Shiite militias in Iraq) and Russia. The sound within Iran and the Resistance Network on Sunday morning is that sound you hear from your car’s GPS after a wrong turn: “Recalculating, recalculating, recalculating.”",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,9,1429,0.076,0.129,0.245,0.588,0.5,0.321,0.248,0.184,0.119,0.5,0.5
165,45392,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,"Israel: Cease-Fire, Get Hostages, Leave Gaza, Rethink Everything","Israel today is at a strategic point in its war in Gaza, and there is every indication that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is going to choose the wrong path — and take the Biden administration along for a very dangerous and troubling ride. It is so dangerous and troubling that Israel’s best option, when all is said and done, might be to leave a rump Hamas leadership in power in Gaza. Yes, you read that right. To understand why, let’s look back a bit. I argued in October that Israel was making a terrible mistake by rushing headlong into invading Gaza, the way America did in Afghanistan after 9/11. I thought Israel should have focused first on getting back its hostages, delegitimizing Hamas for its murderous and rapacious Oct. 7 rampage, and going after Hamas’s leadership in a targeted way — more Munich, less Dresden. That is, a military response akin to how Israel tracked down the killers of its athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics, and not how the U.S. turned Dresden into a pile of rubble in World War II. But I understood that many Israelis felt they had a moral and strategic right and necessity to go into Gaza and remove Hamas “once and for all.” In which case, I argued, Israel would need three things — time, legitimacy, and military and other resources from the U.S. The reason: The ambitious goal of wiping out Hamas could not be completed quickly (if at all); the military operation would end up killing innocent civilians, given how Hamas had tunneled under them; and it would leave a security and government vacuum in Gaza that would have to be filled by the non-Hamas Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, which would have to be upgraded and transformed to take on that task. In short, Israel would need to fight this war with the least collateral damage for Palestinian civilians and accompany it with a political horizon for a new relationship between Israelis and Palestinians, built around two nation-states for two indigenous peoples. Doing so would give Israel a chance to say to the world that this was not a war of vengeance or occupation, but a war to eliminate the Palestinian entity that was out to destroy any two-state solution — Hamas — and create the political space for a deal with the Palestinian Authority, which is still committed to a two-state deal. That approach would have won the support, funding and, I think, even peacekeeping troops of moderate Arab states like the U.A.E. Unfortunately, Netanyahu and his military did not pursue that course. They opted for the worst strategic combination: Militarily they opted for the Dresden approach, which, though it may have ended up killing some 13,000 Hamas fighters, also killed thousands of Palestinian civilians, leaving hundreds of thousands of others injured, displaced or homeless — and delegitimizing, for many around the world, what Israel thought was a just war. And diplomatically, instead of accompanying this war strategy with an initiative that would buy Israel at least some time, legitimacy and resources to dismantle Hamas, Netanyahu refused to offer any political horizon or exit strategy and expressly ruled out any collaboration with the Palestinian Authority under orders from the Jewish supremacists in his governing coalition. That is an utterly insane strategy. It has locked Israel into a politically unwinnable war, and it has ended up isolating America, imperiling our regional and global interests, compromising Israel’s support in the U.S. and fracturing the base of President Biden’s Democratic Party. And the timing is truly awful. The Biden foreign policy team, led by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan, have just finished working out the draft of a new strategic deal with Saudi Arabia — including a civil nuclear program, advanced arms and much deeper security ties. The deal, a senior Biden administration official told me, could be wrapped up in a matter of weeks — but for one element. It hinges on Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel in return for Israel ending the war in Gaza, getting out of the Strip and agreeing to a defined “pathway” for a two-state outcome — with clear metrics in terms of what both Israel and the Palestinian Authority would have to do and in what time frames. We are talking about a game-changing deal — precisely the deal that an Iran-backed Hamas launched this war on Oct. 7 to undermine, because it would have isolated Iran and Hamas. But the war in Gaza has to end first and Israel needs a government ready to embark on a two-state pathway. Which takes us to this fork in the road. My preference is that Israel immediately change course. That is, join with the Biden administration in embracing that pathway to a two-state deal that would open the way for Saudi normalization and also give cover for the Palestinian Authority and moderate Arab states to try to establish non-Hamas governance in Gaza in Israel’s place. And — as the Biden team urged Netanyahu privately — forget entirely about invading Rafah and instead use a targeted approach to take out the rest of the Hamas leadership. Even if Israel is intent on ignoring the U.S. advice, I pray it doesn’t try to invade Rafah and reject Palestinian Authority involvement in Gaza’s future. Because that would be an invitation for a permanent Israeli occupation of Gaza and a permanent Hamas insurgency. It would bleed Israel economically, militarily and diplomatically in very dangerous ways. So dangerous that I believe Israel would actually be better off agreeing to Hamas’s demand for a total Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a cease-fire and an all-for-all deal — all Israeli hostages in return for all Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. In other words, if Israel is not going to partner with the Palestinian Authority and moderate Arab states to create different governance in Gaza, and create conditions for normalizing relations with Saudi Arabia, Israel needs to get its hostages back, end the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, get out of Gaza, have a new election and do a deep rethink. Please, Israel, do not get sucked into Rafah and permanently occupy Gaza. It will be a disaster. “Friedman, you mean you would let a militarily decimated Hamas and its murderous leader Yahya Sinwar govern Gaza again?” Yes, for the near term. As I said, this is not my preferred choice. It’s because Netanyahu has left Israel WITH NO OTHER CHOICE. He refuses to have Israeli troops govern Gaza and won’t bring in the Palestinian Authority. That leaves only two options: Gaza becoming a Somali-like gangland on the Mediterranean; or Gaza being held together with some flimsy Hamas governance. If I were Israel, I’d take a weakened Hamas over Somalia, for two reasons. I have no illusions that the morning after a cease-fire commences and Sinwar comes out, some will wildly cheer him for the hurt he inflicted on Israel. But the morning after the morning after, Sinwar will face brutal questioning from Gazans: Where’s my house, where’s my job, who gave you the right to expose my children to death and devastation? It is the best punishment I can imagine for Sinwar. Let him own all of Gaza’s travails that he so recklessly exacerbated — not Israel. Only Palestinians can delegitimize Hamas, and though it won’t be easy, and Hamas will kill anyone to hold power, this time we won’t be talking about just a handful of dissidents. Amira Hass, Haaretz’s well-informed reporter on Palestinian affairs, recently wrote a story based on phone interviews with Gazans, with this headline: “‘People Are Constantly Cursing Sinwar’: Gazans Opposing Hamas Are Sure They’re the Majority.” It read: “The donkey cart full of people and mattresses is one of the sights of the war on Gaza and the current siege. ‘More than once, I’ve heard a cart owner urging his donkey on and saying something like, “Move it, Yahya Sinwar, move it,”’ says Basel (a pseudonym, as I’ve used for everyone in this article). … Yes, Israel bombs and kills, Basel says, but he refuses to absolve Hamas from responsibility for the catastrophe that has befallen the Gazans. ‘People are constantly cursing Sinwar, but this isn’t reflected in the journalists’ reports,’ he says. ‘I know that I speak for a lot of people,’ Basel says. ‘I have the right to speak, if only because I’m one of the millions whose lives Hamas is gambling with for crazy slogans with no basis in reality.’” For the time, if it happens, when Israel gets out of Gaza and has its hostages back, the Biden team is already talking to Egypt about working closely with the U.S. and Israel to ensure Hamas can never again smuggle in the sorts of arms it did in the past under the Egypt-Gaza border. Israel could say that every ounce of food and medicine that Gazans need will be delivered, as well as the bags of cement for rebuilding from countries that might want to help. But if one ounce is found going to dig new attack tunnels, rebuild rocket factories or restart rocket attacks on Israel, the borders will close. Again, let Sinwar deal with that dilemma: Go back to Hamas’s old ways and starve his people — or keep the cease-fire. The second reason is that it won’t be just Gazans going after Sinwar and Hamas. Plenty of Palestinians understand that Sinwar cynically launched this war because he was losing influence to both more moderate factions in Hamas and to his archrival, the Fatah political movement, which runs the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah. He also feared this possible deal between Israel, Saudi Arabia and the Palestinians. As Hussein Ibish, an expert at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, who has provided some of the most clearsighted analyses of this war from the start, argued in a recent essay in The Daily Beast, Hamas wanted to provoke a massive Israeli response to Oct. 7 in part to corner Fatah. “A surge of nationalist sentiment and shared outrage at the mass killing and suffering of the 2.2 million Palestinian civilians in Gaza muffled nationalist leaders like President Mahmoud Abbas (also the chairman of the P.L.O.) in publicly acknowledging Hamas’ breathtaking cynicism,” he wrote. But now, Ibish notes, the gloves are coming off: When Hamas complained about the Palestinian Authority’s decision to appoint a new prime minister, without Hamas’s input, Fatah shot back with a statement noting that Hamas consulted no one before launching “an adventure on Oct. 7 that has led to a nakba that is more severe than the 1948 nakba.” “Nakba” means catastrophe. Ibish concluded, “If these accusations are repeated — as they certainly should be on a daily, if not hourly, basis — they could create the permission structure for ordinary Palestinians everywhere, and especially in Gaza, to begin honestly asking themselves why Hamas acted on Oct. 7 without regard to the impact on the people of Gaza or making any preparations whatsoever for them.” This dynamic is the only way to marginalize Hamas and Islamic Jihad — by Palestinians themselves discrediting these groups for what they are: mad and murderous proxies of Iran, whose leadership is ready to sacrifice endless Palestinian lives to pursue its aspiration for regional hegemony. If Palestinians cannot or will not do that, they will never get a state. Just a brief word about Iran. As I feared, Israel has played into its hands beautifully from Tehran’s point of view. By invading Gaza with no morning-after plan, while also occupying the West Bank, Israel is now overstretched militarily, economically and morally — while deflecting attention from the fact that Iran is accelerating its nuclear program and expanding its influence as the biggest occupying power in the Middle East today. Iran indirectly controls large swaths of five Arab states or territory (Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen and part of Gaza) using local proxies ready to sell out their own people for Iran’s benefit. Iran has helped to keep each Arab entity war torn or failing. Put me down as opposed to both the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the Iranian occupations of Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen. To decry Israeli settler “colonialism” in the West Bank and ignore Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps “colonialism” in five Arab power centers is utterly dishonest. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards leader who Israel killed in Syria last week was not there on a tourist visa. President Biden has a plan: Get to a six-week cease-fire and hostage release. After which, as part of the Saudi-normalization package, the president will come out with a bold peace initiative, what Israeli peace process expert Gidi Grinstein has called “more for more” — more security and normalization with Arab states than Israel was ever offered and more Arab and U.S. help for Palestinians to achieve statehood than they’ve ever experienced. Hopefully, such an initiative can induce everyone to make the cease-fire permanent, and further marginalize Hamas and Iran. I have read all the articles about how a two-state solution is now impossible. I think they are 95 percent correct. But I am going to focus on the 5-percent chance that they are wrong, and the chance that courageous leadership can make them wrong. Because the alternative is a 100-percent certain forever war, with bigger and more precise weapons that will destroy both societies.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,8,2234,0.381,0.066,0.24,0.059,0.5,0.177,0.08,0.152,0.103,0.5,0.5
166,45363,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,Netanyahu Is Making Israel Radioactive,"Israel today is in grave danger. With enemies like Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and Iran, Israel should be enjoying the sympathy of much of the world. But it is not. Because of the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his extremist coalition have been conducting the war in Gaza and the occupation of the West Bank, Israel is becoming radioactive and diaspora Jewish communities everywhere increasingly insecure. I fear it is about to get worse. No fair-minded person could deny Israel the right of self-defense after the Hamas attack on Oct. 7 killed some 1,200 Israelis in one day. Women were sexually abused, and children were killed in front of their parents and parents in front of their children. Scores of abducted Israeli men, women, children and elderly people are still being held hostage in terrible conditions, now for more than 150 days. But no fair-minded person can look at the Israeli campaign to destroy Hamas that has killed more than 30,000 Palestinians in Gaza, about a third of them fighters, and not conclude that something has gone terribly wrong there. The dead include thousands of children, and the survivors many orphans. So much of Gaza is now a wasteland of death and destruction, hunger and ruined homes. Urban warfare brings out the absolute worst in people, and that is certainly true for Israel in Gaza. This is a stain on the Jewish state. But Israel is not alone in creating this tragedy. The stain on Hamas is black as well. This Islamist militia started the conflict on Oct. 7 without any warnings, protections or shelters for Gazan civilians, and it did so knowing full well from experience that Israel would respond by bombing Hamas strongholds tunneled under homes, mosques and hospitals. Hamas showed a total disregard for the lives of Palestinians, not just Israelis. But Hamas was already branded as a terrorist organization. It is not a U.S. ally and never claimed to practice purity of arms. All of that said, Israel’s standing in the world could take another very big hit soon because of something that made me wary of its invasion from the very start: Netanyahu has sent the Israel Defense Forces into Gaza without a coherent plan for governing it after any Hamas dismantling or cease-fire. In my view, there is only one thing worse for Israel, not to mention Gazans, than a Gaza controlled by Hamas: That’s a Gaza where nobody is in charge, a Gaza where the world will expect Israel to provide order but Israel cannot or will not, so it becomes a permanent, grinding humanitarian crisis. My own recent visit to the Gaza border suggested to me that that is exactly where we’re headed. On March 2, I accompanied the U.S. Centcom commander, Gen. Michael Kurilla, on his visit to the Erez crossing point between Israel and Gaza. Kurilla was in charge of the U.S. humanitarian food airdrop that was about to take place. With the sound of drones buzzing overhead and the distant rumble of artillery, a local Israeli commander explained that most Israeli forces in northern Gaza, which includes its largest urban area, Gaza City, had pulled back either to the Israeli border area or along the road that divides Gaza from north to south. Henceforth, another senior Israeli officer told me, Israeli troops and special forces would go in and out of northern Gaza only to strike at specific Hamas threats, but basically no one was providing day-to-day governance for the civilians left behind, save for a few hundred Hamas fighters and local gang leaders. I immediately understood how a chaotic scene unfolded over food distribution two days earlier. Israel is breaking Hamas’s control yet refusing to take responsibility with its own forces for civilian administration in Gaza — and refusing to enlist the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, which has thousands of employees in Gaza, to perform that task. It is behaving this way because Netanyahu does not want the P.A. to become the Palestinian government in the West Bank and Gaza, which might give it a chance at credibility to grow into an independent Palestinian state there one day. In other words, Israel has a prime minister who apparently would rather see Gaza devolve into Somalia, ruled by warlords, and risk Israel’s military gains in dismantling Hamas than partner with the Palestinian Authority or any legitimate, broad-based, non-Hamas Palestinian governing body — because his far-right cabinet allies, who dream of Israel controlling all the territory between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean, including Gaza, will oust him from power if he does. Netanyahu’s government is apparently hoping to enlist local Palestinian clan leaders to post-Hamas Gaza, but I seriously doubt that will work. Israel tried and failed that strategy in the West Bank in the 1980s, as these locals were often stigmatized as collaborators and never gained governing traction. I confess that as I contemplated all of this from the border, I had two flashbacks that were sort of daytime nightmares. The first was remembering how the U.S. invaded Iraq with the aim of building a new democratic order to replace Saddam Hussein’s tyranny, which I supported. But when it came to implementation, the Bush administration broke the Iraqi Army and the ruling Baath Party with no coherent plan for creating better alternative governance. This turned many anti-Hussein Iraqis against the U.S. and created the conditions for the anti-U.S. insurgency. I summarized all of this in a column published on April 9, 2003. It was 20 days after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, and I had entered the country with a team from the Kuwaiti Red Cross that was delivering medical supplies to the main hospital in the Iraqi port of Umm Qasr. There were three things I noticed almost immediately: how few U.S. or allied troops were around keeping order, what chaos this was producing and how sullen the people were. I wrote it this way: It’s hard to smile when there’s no water. It’s hard to applaud when you’re frightened. It’s hard to say, “Thank you for liberating me,” when liberation has meant that looters have ransacked everything from the grain silos to the local school, where they even took away the blackboard. … It would be idiotic to even ask Iraqis here how they felt about politics. They are in a prepolitical, primordial state of nature. For the moment, Saddam has been replaced by Hobbes, not Bush. I added that I had gone in with members of a Kuwaiti relief team, “who, taking pity on the Iraqis, tossed out extra food from a bus window as we left. The Umm Qasr townsfolk scrambled after that food … jostling for breadcrumbs. This was a scene of humiliation, not liberation. We must do better.” I concluded: “America broke Iraq; now America owns Iraq, and it owns the primary responsibility for normalizing it. If the water doesn’t flow, if the food doesn’t arrive, if the rains don’t come and if the sun doesn’t shine, it’s now America’s fault. We’d better get used to it, we’d better make things right, we’d better do it soon, and we’d better get all the help we can get.” Flashback No. 2: It is May 22, 2018, and I am writing near the Gaza border with Israel a column that would be titled “Hamas, Netanyahu and Mother Nature.” Relying on data from Israeli and Palestinian environmentalists, I wrote about how — because of Hamas’s mismanagement of the Gaza economy and diversion of building materials to dig tunnels to penetrate Israel — Gaza was suffering a critical shortage of infrastructure, particularly sewage treatment plants. So Gazans were dumping about 100 million liters of raw sewage into the Mediterranean every day. Why should Israelis care? After all, Gaza is “over there,” behind a fence. Meet Mother Nature. Because of the prevailing current in the Mediterranean, most of Gaza’s untreated sewage dumped into the Mediterranean flowed northward to the Israeli beach town of Ashkelon, the site of Israel’s second-largest desalination plant. Eighty percent of Israel’s drinking water comes from desalination and 15 percent of its drinking water from that Ashkelon plant alone. As a result of Gaza’s floating waste, that Ashkelon desalination plant had to close several times to clean Gaza’s gunk out of its filters. Israelis and Palestinians are interdependent. Lost there, felt here. The only question is whether they can one day forge a healthy interdependency or will be doomed to an unhealthy interdependency. But interdependent they will be. Each community needs a leader whose actions are motivated by that fundamental truth.

167,45356,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,Inside America’s Shadow War With Iran,"It’s often been said that the most dangerous hot spot in the world is the waterway between Taiwan and mainland China, where the Chinese Navy and Air Force flex their muscles every day to try to intimidate Taiwan — while the U.S. Navy patrols nearby. I wonder. There is actually a stable balance of deterrence there right now. You could hold a friendly regatta in the Taiwan Straits compared to where I just visited. I spent two days last week hopscotching in a CH-47 Chinook helicopter among seven U.S. military bases in western Jordan and eastern Syria with America’s senior Middle East Centcom commander, Gen. Michael Kurilla. There is no equilibrium here. What you have, instead, is the other Middle East war that began shortly after the tragic Israel-Hamas war that broke out on Oct. 7. This other Middle East war pits Iran and its proxies — the Houthis, Hezbollah and Shiite militias in Iraq — against both the small network of U.S. bases in Syria, Jordan and Iraq established after 2014 to destroy the ISIS Islamic state and against the U.S. naval presence in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden that keeps the vital shipping lanes there secure and open. These Iranian-armed Shiite militias in Iraq and the Houthi fighters in Yemen may not look or seem like lethal threats, but do not be fooled. They have learned to arm, build, adapt and deploy some of the most sophisticated precision weaponry in the world. That weaponry, provided by Iran, can hit a three-foot-wide target 500 miles away. The young U.S. soldiers and sailors arrayed against them cut their teeth on video games, but now find themselves playing the real thing, deploying with software and cursors the world’s most sophisticated countermeasures and interceptors to swat away almost every rocket and drone the Iranian proxies have been throwing at them. In short, Americans may not know they’re at war with Iran, but Iran’s Revolutionary Guards know for sure they are in a shadow war with America through their proxies. And if one of these Iranian proxies gets “lucky” and creates a mass casualty event by striking a U.S. warship or the barracks of one of the U.S. bases in Jordan or Syria — something akin to the Marine Corps barracks bombing in Beirut in 1983 — the U.S.-Iran conflict would surely come out of the shadows and become a direct shooting war in the region the world most depends on for its oil. Just thought I’d let you know. This other Middle East war kicked into high gear on Oct. 17, 10 days after the attack on Israel by Hamas, Centcom officials explained to me, when Iran clearly took a decision to rev up all its proxies. Under the cover of the Gaza war and tempted by the anti-American sentiment it has generated, Iran tried to see if it could significantly degrade the U.S. network of facilities in Iraq, eastern Syria and northern Jordan, or perhaps dislodge U.S. forces altogether. I suspect Tehran also had another goal in mind: to intimidate America’s Arab allies by showing them the damage Iran could inflict on their U.S. protector. What I know for sure, though, is that this is the most dangerous game of chicken going on anywhere on the planet today, for three reasons. The first is the sheer volume of rockets, drones and missiles that Iran’s proxies have deployed — particularly the Houthis in Yemen and the Shiite militias in Iraq. According to Centcom, hundreds of warheads carried by Iranian-supplied land-to-sea rockets, cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, attack drones, suicide speedboats and unmanned underwater vehicles have been fired since Oct. 17 by Iran’s proxies at U.S. bases, warships and commercial vessels in the Red Sea. Fortunately, despite the volume of attacks, the U.S. has managed to destroy or deflect most of the incoming with interceptors and a growing electronic forest of radars and countermeasures being deployed at the bases and on U.S. warships. This is no easy task; several rockets and drones have gotten through, injuring over 180 U.S. personnel so far, Centcom said, and I saw the physical damage they did at several bases we visited. These U.S. bases are not luxury compounds. Many started as ramshackle ISIS-controlled bases or small towns that the U.S. and its Kurdish allies took over beginning in 2014 after intense firefights with ISIS in a war that threatened the governments of Syria, Iraq and Jordan all at the same time. Today, they consist of prefab living quarters surrounded and separated by hundreds and hundreds of concrete blast walls imported by the U.S. to limit the damage of any incoming warheads. Spotty wireless enables soldiers to FaceTime with families and follow sports. Spartan kitchens serve corn dogs, chicken nuggets and the like, and at some of the “nicer” facilities, maybe even a daily selection of fresh fruit — though when you’re a 70-year-old visitor carrying around 50 pounds of body armor and a helmet, it’s amazing how good a big fat corn dog from an Army mess in the Syrian desert can taste. But because these bases were designed and situated to block ISIS from reconstituting its supply lines and critical mass, they were never meant to deter or attack the vast modern rocket arsenals of Iran and its proxies. Which is why on Jan. 28, a one-way Iranian attack drone with a 20-pound warhead, launched by a coalition of Iranian-backed Shiite militias called the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, hit a U.S. facility, Tower 22, in northeastern Jordan. I visited Tower 22 with General Kurilla’s team last week. The blast killed three U.S. soldiers, who were blown right out of their bunks, and injured 47. Fortunately, the modular living quarters there were separated by blast walls. A soldier in the bunkhouse right next to the one hit told us he was talking to his wife on FaceTime when the drone struck; protected by a thick cement barrier, he emerged shaken but unscathed. Watching live, his wife thought he was dead when he disappeared in smoke but he was able to contact her three hours later and assure her otherwise. I was surprised to learn just how aggressive the Iranians have encouraged their proxies to be, which is what leads to the second, extremely dangerous aspect of this war. It was what General Kurilla dryly described to me as a deterrence “conversation” Centcom had with Iran after the Tower 22 attack to make clear to Tehran that it was playing with fire. On Feb. 2, the U.S. launched airstrikes against the whole Iranian proxy network in Iraq and Syria, and the next day against Houthi sites in Yemen, hitting more than 100 targets overall, with a combination of long-range B-1 bombers out of Texas, and cruise missiles and fighter bombers launched from the Eisenhower carrier group in the Red Sea. Some 40 people were reported to have been killed in the U.S. retaliatory strikes. The operation was then capped off on Feb. 7 when the U.S. decided to demonstrate to Iran and its proxies what kind of combined intelligence/precision warfare the U.S. can deploy by killing Abu Baqir al-Saedi, the specific commander from Kataib Hezbollah who the U.S. determined was in charge of drone attacks on its bases in Iraq, Jordan and Syria. Al-Saedi was hit while driving on a Baghdad street by the same kind of drone-fired Hellfire missile that killed the senior Iranian Revolutionary Guard commander Qassim Suleimani in 2020. It was equipped with six swordlike blades that once it penetrates a vehicle slice and dice anything in their path like a blender, which is why the missile has been nicknamed the “Flying Ginsu.” This American response clearly got the Iranians’ attention, and Iran’s proxies have been observing an undeclared cease-fire on land ever since, which certainly helped ease my mind as we flew around in helicopters and a C-130 all over the ungoverned spaces of eastern Syria, too close for my comfort one day near the joint Russian-Iranian base on the western side of the Euphrates. This informal cease-fire, though, has not been embraced by the Houthis, who have declared that they will not stop firing at international ships, the U.S. Navy or Israel, at least until there is a cease-fire in Gaza. Last weekend, the Belize-flagged cargo ship Rubymar, which the Houthis hit with an anti-ship ballistic missile on Feb. 18, became the first vessel to entirely sink in the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, as a result of a Houthi missile attack. It created a huge ecological mess of leaked fuel and the fertilizer it was carrying. Thank you, Houthis. And that leads to the third dangerous aspect of this shadow war. At every base we visited there was a top-secret room journalists could not go into, called the combat integration center. Inside, young American soldiers (and sailors on Navy vessels) stare at screens, try to identify the myriad objects flying toward them and decide by its radar and visual signature whether to engage one, ignore another or let a third go by, figuring it is going to miss and land harmlessly. Discipline is important when you’re firing $200,000 interceptors at $20,000 Iranian drones, a Centcom officer told me. These operators often have less than 90 seconds to make up their mind whether to engage an incoming drone with a Coyote drone-interceptor that can detect and destroy attack drones at very close range and can be launched from ground vehicles, helicopters or surface vessels. In other words, every day is pregnant with a low-probability-but-high-consequence event. And the first, and often last, line of defense is usually a 20-something U.S. soldier or sailor squinting at a computer screen, trying to decide with software within seconds what is coming his or her way and engaging the right countermeasures. Amid all of this, I should add, we also visited Al Hol detention camp in the middle of nowhere in northeastern Syria, where some 43,000 people — mostly ISIS “brides” and their children — are being held in tents and prefabs under Kurdish guards until they can be deprogrammed and returned to their home countries. It is pretty strange to talk to an American or British woman who got drawn into the ISIS cult and hear that she has five or six kids by three or four different ISIS combatants, all of whom were killed by the U.S.-led coalition. Judging from the number of rocks some of the kids threw at our armored convoy, the deprogramming process has a way to go. stay? First let me describe a scene, and then offer an answer. The scene: General Kurilla’s team was visiting the Tanf garrison, a small logistics support base inside Syria, near where Syria, Iraq and Jordan meet. Kurilla took the opportunity to do a battlefield promotion, from second lieutenant to first lieutenant, for a medical platoon leader stationed there. We were standing in an alley and around us were all just different shades of brown — the desert, the buildings, you name it. Kurilla first asked for someone to get him an American flag and a couple of minutes later two platoon members showed up with a small one and held it up at shoulder level, framing Kurilla and the young officer being promoted. “Our army is unique in the world,” Kurilla said to the young man. “We don’t swear an oath to a person or a king, we swear an oath to an idea, embodied in the Constitution and ingrained in our democracy, that all men and women are created equal. We swear an oath to defend that idea.” Kurilla then administered the oath that every U.S. soldier — this one an enlistee who had worked his way up — repeats as he or she rises in rank. His oath complete, the newly minted first lieutenant slapped on a cap displaying his new rank and then gave a shout-out to each member of his platoon. There was something about that scene that hit me: the two soldiers holding up their little Stars and Stripes that provided the only color in this vast brown tableau, and the oath of allegiance to an idea, not a king, muffled by the protective blast walls of this far-flung base in a region that has mostly known only the opposite. During the post-Cold War era, from the early 1990s to the 2010s, I thought it might actually be possible to bring more consensual politics and pluralism to this part of the world — thanks to the Oslo Accords, the Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty, the Arab Spring uprisings and the greater integration that was resulting from globalization. But it did not happen. Rather than the spread of democracy this region experienced metastasizing disorder and failing states. At the same time, the big divide in the world became no longer between democracy and autocracy, but between order and disorder. The best case for U.S. forces remaining in eastern Syria, Iraq and the Red Sea is precisely so that the disorder “over there” — from the likes of ISIS, failed states like Syria and the eating away of nation-states by Iranian proxy militias — doesn’t come “over here.” It is not a pretty or heroic mission — living in body armor all day in a harsh and hostile environment, with all the corn dogs you can eat as one of the few pleasures — but it’s probably worth it. That said, we should have no illusions about the risks because the shadow war playing out there could come screaming out of the shadows at any moment.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6,2261,0.374,0.329,0.191,0.5,0.5,0.147,0.158,0.5,0.181,0.5,0.5
168,45349,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,Israel Is Losing Its Greatest Asset: Acceptance,"I’ve spent the past few days traveling from New Delhi to Dubai and Amman, and I have an urgent message to deliver to President Biden and the Israeli people: I am seeing the increasingly rapid erosion of Israel’s standing among friendly nations — a level of acceptance and legitimacy that was painstakingly built up over decades. And if Biden is not careful, America’s global standing will plummet right along with Israel’s. I don’t think Israelis or the Biden administration fully appreciate the rage that is bubbling up around the world, fueled by social media and TV footage, over the deaths of so many thousands of Palestinian civilians, particularly children, with U.S.-supplied weapons in Israel’s war in Gaza. Hamas has much to answer for in triggering this human tragedy, but Israel and the U.S. are seen as driving events now and getting most of the blame. That such anger is boiling over in the Arab world is obvious, but I heard it over and over again in conversations in India during the past week — from friends, business leaders, an official and journalists both young and old. That is even more telling because the Hindu-dominated government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the only major power in the global south that has supported Israel and consistently blamed Hamas for inviting the massive Israeli retaliation and the deaths of an estimated 30,000 people, according to Gazan health officials, the majority of them civilians. That many civilian deaths in a relatively short war would be problematic in any context. But when so many civilians die in a retaliatory invasion that was launched by an Israeli government without any political horizon for the morning after — and then, when the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, finally offers a morning-after plan that essentially says to the world that Israel now intends to occupy both the West Bank and Gaza indefinitely — it is no surprise that Israel’s friends will edge away and the Biden team will start to look hapless. As Shekhar Gupta, the veteran editor of the Indian newspaper ThePrint, put it to me: “There’s enormous love and admiration for Israel in India. But a war with no end will strain it. Initial shock and awe apart, Netanyahu’s war is damaging Israel’s greatest asset: the widely held belief in the invincibility of its army, the infallibility of its intelligence services and the justness of its mission.” Each day brings new calls for Israel to be banned from international academic, artistic and athletic competitions or events. That so much of it is hypocritical in singling out Israel for censure — while ignoring the excesses of Iran, Russia, Syria and China, not to mention Hamas — is true. But this Israeli government is doing things that make it too easy. Many of Israel’s friends are now just praying for a cease-fire so that they don’t have to be asked by their citizens or voters — especially their youth — how they can be indifferent to so many mounting civilian casualties in Gaza. In particular, many Arab leaders who privately want to see Hamas destroyed, who understand what a warped and destructive force it is, are being pressured from the streets to the elites to publicly distance themselves from an Israel that is unwilling to consider any political horizon for Palestinian independence on any border. Or, as Netanyahu put it in the morning-after plan he issued last Friday: Israel will keep security control over Gaza, the territory will be demilitarized, the strip’s southern border with Egypt will be sealed much more tightly in coordination with Cairo, the United Nations agency that provides primary health and education services for Palestinian refugees will be disbanded and education and administration will be completely overhauled. Civil administration and day-to-day policing will be based on “local elements with administrative and management experience.” Who will pay for all of this and how local Palestinians will be enlisted to perpetuate Israel’s control is not explained. I have real sympathy for the strategic dilemma that Israel faced on Oct. 7 — a surprise attack by Hamas that was designed to make Israel crazy by murdering parents in front of their children, children in front of their parents, sexually abusing and mutilating women and kidnapping infants and grandparents. It was pure barbarism. It felt to me, at least, that the world was ready initially to accept that there were going to be significant civilian casualties if Israel was going to root out Hamas and recover its hostages, because Hamas had embedded itself in tunnels under homes, hospitals, mosques and schools and made no preparations of its own to protect Gazan civilians from the Israeli retaliation it knew it would trigger. But now we have a toxic combination of thousands of civilian casualties and a Netanyahu peace plan that promises only endless occupation, no matter if the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank transforms itself into a legitimate, effective, broad-based governing body that can take control of both the West Bank and Gaza and be a partner one day for peace. So the whole Israel-Gaza operation is starting to look to more and more people like a human meat grinder whose only goal is to reduce the population so that Israel can control it more easily. Netanyahu refuses to even consider trying to nurture a new relationship with non-Hamas Palestinians, because to do so would risk his prime minister’s chair, which depends on backing by hard-right Jewish supremacist parties who will never cede an inch of the West Bank. Hard to believe, but Netanyahu is ready to sacrifice Israel’s hard-won international legitimacy for his personal political needs. He will not hesitate to take Biden down with him. But the broader point is that a unique opportunity to permanently diminish Hamas, not only as an army but also as a political movement, is being squandered because Netanyahu refuses to encourage any prospect, however long term, of building toward a two-state solution. Still so traumatized by Oct. 7, Israelis, in my view, are failing to see that at least making an effort to move slowly toward a Palestinian state led by a transformed Palestinian Authority and conditioned on demilitarization and hitting certain institutional governance goals is not a gift to Palestinians or a reward for Hamas. It is instead the most hard-nosed, selfish thing Israelis could now do for themselves — because Israel is losing on three fronts at once today. It is losing the global narrative that it is fighting a just war. It has no plan to ever get out of Gaza, so it will eventually sink into the sands there with a permanent occupation that will surely complicate relations with all its Arab allies and friends across the globe. And it is losing regionally to Iran and its anti-Israel proxies in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen, who are pressuring Israel’s northern, southern and eastern borders. There is one fix that would help on all three fronts: an Israeli government prepared to begin the process of building two nation-states for two peoples, with a Palestinian Authority that is truly ready and willing to transform itself. That changes the narrative. It gives cover for Israel’s Arab allies to partner with Israel in rebuilding Gaza, and it provides the glue for the regional alliance Israel needs to confront Iran and its proxies. In failing to see that, I believe Israel is imperiling decades of diplomacy to get the world to recognize the right of the Jewish people to national self-determination and self-defense in their historic homeland. It is also relieving Palestinians of the burden and depriving them of the opportunity of recognizing two nation-states for two people and building the necessary institutions and compromises to make that happen. And, I repeat, it is going to put the Biden administration in an increasingly untenable position. And it is making Iran’s day.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,7,1311,0.064,0.24,0.104,0.121,0.5,0.107,0.243,0.095,0.095,0.5,0.5
169,45335,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,Only Biden and M.B.S. Can Redirect the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict,"One of the most unexpected developments in the Israel-Hamas war is the emergence of a powerful alignment of interests and incentives for Israel, the Palestinians, America and Saudi Arabia to all get behind a pathway to a Palestinian state that can live in peace alongside Israel. For starters, moving toward a Palestinian state — once this war ends — is the key for Israel reconnecting with important constituencies around the world, it’s the key to an eventual secure pathway out of Gaza, and it is the cement for the regional alliance Israel needs to protect itself. I understand why many in an Israeli society still traumatized by the Hamas surprise attack on Oct. 7 don’t want to hear talk of a Palestinian state, even in a demilitarized form. But for many Israelis that was true for years before the Gaza war. To continue ignoring the subject now would be a grave error. Israel needs to shape it, not ignore it. If Israel destroys Hamas and then decides to permanently occupy Gaza and the West Bank, rejecting any form of Palestinian statehood, Israel will become a global pariah for the next generation, particularly in the Arab world. This will force Israel’s Arab allies to distance themselves from the Jewish state. And if Israel remains in perpetual conflict with the Palestinians, the entire architecture of America’s Middle East strategy — particularly the crosscutting peace treaties that we’ve forged between Israel and Egypt, Jordan and the Gulf nations — will come under pressure, complicating our ability to operate in the region and opening it to much more influence by Russia and China. Given the deaths of so many thousands of Gazan civilians, the U.S. is already having some difficulty using its military bases in Arab countries to counter Iran’s malign network of Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and Shiite militias in Iraq. And the Saudis need a pathway to a Palestinian state in order to normalize ties with Israel and thereby win support in the U.S. Congress for some kind of new U.S.-Saudi security pact. In short, more key players in the Middle East need movement toward a demilitarized Palestinian state today than at any time that I can remember — most of all the Palestinians, for whom this moment offers a unique opportunity to realize their dream of independence in their homeland in a state next to Israel. To say that it will be incredibly hard to achieve doesn’t begin to address the complexities, but Palestinians too need to be defining it and building better institutions to achieve it through an upgraded Palestinian Authority in Ramallah, in the West Bank — now, today, urgently. But I have no illusions. There are two key players who do not want this to happen, under any conditions, and they are very powerful: Hamas, which is dedicated to wiping Israel off the map, as it demonstrated on Oct. 7; and Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right coalition partners — some of whom want not only to destroy Hamas but also to continue occupying the West Bank and Gaza and expanding Jewish settlements in both. Alas, if I’ve learned anything since starting this column in 1995, it’s that neither Hamas nor Netanyahu could ever be partners for any kind of Palestinian state next to Israel, even though it could serve the interests of the Israeli and Palestinian people now more than ever. Let me explain my assessment of Hamas and Netanyahu with a couple of scenes from recent history. The first is from 2002. Twenty-two years ago this week, when Sept. 11 still cast a long shadow over the world, I went to Saudi Arabia and interviewed Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz. Before going, I wrote a column in the voice of President George W. Bush asking Arab leaders to lay down a constructive peace initiative: Offer Israel full peace and normalization in return for a full Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem to the 1967 lines. After I spent a week of touring Saudi Arabia, Abdullah invited me to his horse farm outside Riyadh, along with my host, Adel al-Jubeir, then the spokesman at the Saudi Embassy in Washington and later the foreign minister. After a buffet dinner groaning with Arab dishes and attended by lots of princes and businessmen, around midnight, Abdullah invited Adel and me back to his study. I began by urging Abdullah to consider my then-radical idea from my column, of getting the whole Arab League to offer Israel full peace for full withdrawal to begin some healing after Sept. 11. He looked at me with mock astonishment and said, ”Have you broken into my desk?” “No,” I said, wondering what he was talking about. “The reason I ask,” he explained, “is that this is exactly the idea I had in mind — full withdrawal from all the occupied territories, in accord with U.N. resolutions, including in Jerusalem, for full normalization of relations. I have drafted a speech along those lines. My thinking was to deliver it before the Arab summit and try to mobilize the entire Arab world behind it. The speech is written, and it is in my desk. But I changed my mind about delivering it” after a recent Israeli crackdown in the West Bank by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. We talked about this idea until about 3 a.m. when I got up and said something to the effect of, “Your Highness, you need to take this idea out of your desk and share it publicly.” “I tell you,” the crown prince said, “if I were to pick up the phone now and ask someone to read you the speech, you will find it virtually identical to what you are talking about. I wanted to find a way to make clear to the Israeli people that the Arabs don’t reject or despise them. But the Arab people do reject what their leadership is now doing to the Palestinians, which is inhumane and oppressive. And I thought of this as a possible signal to the Israeli people.” He concluded, “Let me say to you that the speech is written, and it is still in my drawer.” Then I countered with this idea: “Let me write up your proposal as an on-the-record interview.” With Adel translating, Abdullah responded, “No, you just say that this is something I am thinking about.” I said, “No, I think you should say it.” He said, “No, you should say it.” I said, “No, you should say it.” Eventually, he agreed to sleep on it. Midmorning the next day, Adel called to say, “Go with it.” I knew this was being done in part to distract attention from Sept. 11, in which 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudis. But I thought it could really move the needle. That Sunday we ran Abdullah’s words in a column headlined “An Intriguing Signal From the Saudi Crown Prince.” All hell broke loose in the Arab world and Israel after it came out, and Arab leaders quickly decided that this would be the subject of the coming Arab League summit in Beirut. On March 27 and 28 virtually all the Arab leaders gathered in the Lebanese capital. Working off Abdullah’s basic proposal, they added several other conditions on the right of return of refugees and on March 28 approved what became known as the Arab Peace Initiative, offering “normal relations” between the Arab states and Israel in return for Israeli withdrawal from all the territories back to the lines of June 4, 1967. It was the first and remains the only comprehensive Arab peace overture to Israel approved by the Arab League, including even Syria. I honestly thought that this could be the beginning of the end of the conflict. But it never went anywhere. Neither the Israelis nor the Bush administration really seized the moment. How could Israel not have jumped right on it? Well, a lot had to do with what happened in Israel on the evening of March 27, right after the Arab League summit opened. I’ll let CNN tell you the news of that night: NETANYA, Israel — A suicide bomber killed at least 19 people and injured 172 at a popular seaside hotel Wednesday, the start of the Jewish religious holiday of Passover. At least 48 of the injured were described as “severely wounded.” The bombing occurred in a crowded dining room at the Park Hotel, a coastal resort, during the traditional meal marking the start of Passover. … The Palestinian group Hamas, an Islamic fundamentalist group labeled a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department, claimed responsibility for the attack. Yes, this is how Hamas welcomed the first Pan-Arab peace initiative calling for full Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 lines and the creation of a Palestinian state next to Israel. Israel responded to the Hamas terrorist attack by besieging Yasir Arafat in his office in Ramallah and everything just went downhill from there. Hamas is a longtime enemy of reconciliation, which makes it in my mind an enemy of the Palestinian people as much as of Israel. The attack Hamas launched on Israel on Oct. 7 was not a cry for peace by an organization that had no other options. It was a brutal down payment on Israel’s destruction. One reason Hamas is so strong today is that Netanyahu has done everything he could for the last decade and a half to undermine the Palestinian Authority, which was created as part of the Oslo agreements, governs the Palestinian-populated areas in the West Bank and cooperates with Israeli security services. At the same time, in recent years, Netanyahu deliberately strengthened Hamas, which has controlled Gaza since ousting the Palestinian Authority in 2007. That is because he and Hamas share the same objective: weakening the Palestinian Authority and preventing a two-state solution. Aluf Benn, the editor of Haaretz, tells the whole story in two paragraphs in a recent essay in Foreign Affairs: Since Netanyahu returned to office in 2009, his strategy has been to argue that Israel “could prosper as a Western-style country — and even reach out to the Arab world at large — while pushing aside the Palestinians. The key was to divide and conquer. In the West Bank, Netanyahu maintained security cooperation with the Palestinian Authority, which became Israel’s de facto policing and social services subcontractor, and he encouraged Qatar to fund Gaza’s Hamas government.” Benn then reminds us of another key scene, where Netanyahu told his party’s parliamentary caucus in 2019 that this was a deliberate strategy: “‘Whoever opposes a Palestinian state,’ said Netanyahu, ‘must support delivery of funds to Gaza because maintaining separation between the P.A. in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza will prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state.’” So pardon me if I hold a very dark view of Netanyahu’s intentions when it comes to two states as well. Unfortunately, the longer the war in Gaza goes on, the more the views of Hamas and Netanyahu are infecting whole societies. More and more Palestinians and their supporters in the West are embracing the view that all of Israel is a colonial settler enterprise that must be destroyed from the river to the sea, and more and more Israelis refuse to even contemplate any Palestinian state on their borders. That’s why I was not surprised the other day to hear President Biden lament from the White House that Israel’s conduct in the Gaza Strip “has been over the top” and that “it’s got to stop.” As I listened to Biden, though, it struck me that he sounded more like a columnist than a president — an observer, not someone with the power to change things. We cannot let that attitude take root. And there are only two leaders with the power to completely redirect this story right now: President Biden and the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. To both of them, I say: Finish the job that your predecessors started. M.B.S., if you want to defeat both Netanyahu and Hamas, you have to pick up where your uncle Abdullah left off. You need to declare that you are ready to go to Jerusalem, to first pray in Al Aqsa Mosque and then speak to the Israeli people from the podium of the Knesset in order to tell them directly: If you embark on a pathway of two states for two people, Saudi Arabia will normalize relations with Israel and recognize West Jerusalem as its capital — as long as Israel recognizes Arab East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine. You can also pledge that Saudi Arabia will support the rebuilding of Gaza. In 1979, President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt made a similar move, which enshrined his place in history as one of the greatest leaders of the 20th century. M.B.S., if you brave going to Jerusalem, the U.S.-Saudi security alliance should easily get through Congress and become the keystone of a regional alliance against Iran and its axis of failed states and proxies that are sucking the life out of Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. And Joe Biden needs to pick up where Bill Clinton left off. On Dec. 23, 2000, President Clinton presented a basket of ideas called the “Clinton parameters,” detailing how to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. They are based on the principle of two nation-states for two peoples. Sadly, Clinton did not get to see the job finished and added at the time, “I have taken this as far as I can.” Your job now, Joe, is to carry those ideas forward to forge two states for two peoples in one land. This is your time to make bold moves that will signal to Israelis and Palestinians, to the Middle East and the world: America is serious about seeing through the two-state solution. Since Netanyahu won’t negotiate a Palestinian state, you can recognize the Palestinian Authority as a state unilaterally. As the Israeli peace process veteran Gidi Grinstein, a co-author of “(In)Sights: Peace Making in the Oslo Process Thirty Years and Counting,” just wrote in The Times of Israel: “Upgrading the P.A. into a state could turn the breakdown of Israeli-Palestinian relations into a breakthrough toward peaceful coexistence.”So let me end where I began: I totally get why Israelis, who every day are taking fire from Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis, do not want to discuss a two-state solution with the Palestinians right now. But envisaging such a future, if it can be done right, is not a reward for what Hamas did on Oct. 7. It’s a way — maybe the only — to sustainably ensure that it never happens again. And with Gaza engulfed by conflict and the West Bank boiling, I realize it’s not as if Palestinians can call a constitutional convention. But to the extent that the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah can undertake reforms that visibly enhance its effectiveness and credibility as a peace partner, the payoff could be enormous. Once the guns fall silent in Gaza, we may be looking at the best opportunity for a two-state solution since the collapse of Oslo. It also might be the last.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,9,2524,0.236,0.736,0.459,0.154,0.5,0.513,0.637,0.667,0.468,0.5,0.5
170,45322,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,A Biden Doctrine for the Middle East Is Forming. And It’s Big.,"There are two things I believe about the widening crisis in the Middle East. We are about to see a new Biden administration strategy unfold to address this multifront war involving Gaza, Iran, Israel and the region — what I hope will be a “Biden Doctrine” that meets the seriousness and complexity of this dangerous moment. And if we don’t see such a big, bold doctrine, the crisis in the region is going to metastasize in ways that will strengthen Iran, isolate Israel and leave America’s ability to influence events there for the better in tatters. A Biden Doctrine — as I’m terming the convergence of strategic thinking and planning that my reporting has picked up — would have three tracks. On one track would be a strong and resolute stand on Iran, including a robust military retaliation against Iran’s proxies and agents in the region in response to the killing of three U.S. soldiers at a base in Jordan by a drone apparently launched by a pro-Iranian militia in Iraq. On the second track would be an unprecedented U.S. diplomatic initiative to promote a Palestinian state — NOW. It would involve some form of U.S. recognition of a demilitarized Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip that would come into being only once Palestinians had developed a set of defined, credible institutions and security capabilities to ensure that this state was viable and that it could never threaten Israel. Biden administration officials have been consulting experts inside and outside the U.S. government about different forms this recognition of Palestinian statehood might take. On the third track would be a vastly expanded U.S. security alliance with Saudi Arabia, which would also involve Saudi normalization of relations with Israel — if the Israeli government is prepared to embrace a diplomatic process leading to a demilitarized Palestinian state led by a transformed Palestinian Authority. If the administration can pull this together — a huge if — a Biden Doctrine could become the biggest strategic realignment in the region since the 1979 Camp David treaty. The three tracks absolutely have to be tied together, though, for a Biden Doctrine to succeed. I believe U.S. officials understand this. Because this I know for sure: Oct. 7 is forcing a fundamental rethinking about the Middle East within the Biden administration, given the barbaric Hamas attack on Israel; the massive Israeli retaliation against Hamas that has killed thousands of innocent Palestinian civilians in Gaza; the widening attacks on Israeli and U.S. personnel in the region; and the inability of Israel’s right-wing government to articulate any plan for governing Gaza the morning after the war’s end with a non-Hamas Palestinian partner. The rethinking underway signals an awareness that we can no longer allow Iran to try to drive us out of the region, Israel into extinction and our Arab allies into intimidation by acting through proxies — Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and Shiite militias in Iraq — while Tehran blithely sits back and pays no price. And, simultaneously, it signals an awareness that the U.S. will never have the global legitimacy, the NATO allies and the Arab and Muslim allies it needs to take on Iran in a more aggressive manner unless we stop letting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hold our policy hostage and we start building a credible, legitimate Palestinian Authority that can one day govern Gaza and the West Bank effectively and as a good neighbor to Israel along final borders they would negotiate together. Nader Mousavizadeh, founder and C.E.O. of the geopolitical consulting firm Macro Advisory Partners and a senior adviser to then-U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, describes this emerging Biden Doctrine as “the dual reckoning strategy.” “You strategically call Iran’s bluff and, at the same time, you embark on an unprecedented initiative to lay the groundwork for a demilitarized Palestinian state, in ways the U.S. has never done before,” said Mousavizadeh. “Each track needs the other to succeed. Each track bolsters and justifies the other. Pushing back on Iran and its proxies in an enhanced and sustained manner strengthens Israel’s security and the security of our Arab allies. Pairing that with an authentic and bold U.S. commitment to a Palestinian state gives us legitimacy to act against Iran and the allies we need to be most effective. It also isolates Iran militarily and politically.” I think this is exactly right. It is way past time for the U.S. to call both Iran and Netanyahu’s bluffs. Netanyahu is the reason I coined this rule of Middle East reporting: “Whatever people say to you in English in private is irrelevant. All that matters is what they say in public in their own language.” Netanyahu has been whispering to Biden in private that he might be ready one day — maybe — to consider some kind of demilitarized Palestinian state, while in Hebrew in public he has been saying just the opposite. Fortunately, Biden has been around the track enough times to know that Netanyahu is just trying to string him along. Sometimes age is an advantage. Time to call Netanyahu’s and the ayatollahs’ games at the same time. A Biden Doctrine is the right way to do it. We have tolerated Iran destroying every constructive initiative we have been trying to build in the Middle East — just as long as Tehran stays below the threshold of directly attacking us. And, at the same time, we have tolerated a Netanyahu government that is out to permanently prevent any form of Palestinian statehood, even to the point of bolstering Hamas against the Palestinian Authority for many years to ensure that there would be no unified Palestinian partner. “Oct. 7 revealed that our Iran policy was bankrupt and our Israel-Palestine policy was bankrupt,” Mousavizadeh said. “Those policies enabled and empowered Hamas to savage Israel. They enabled and empowered the Houthis to paralyze global shipping, and they enabled pro-Iranian Shiite militias to try to drive U.S. forces out of the region — forces deployed there to prevent ISIS from returning and help to keep the region reasonably stable.” All of this transpired, he added, without anyone holding the regime in Tehran responsible for the way “it deploys its poisonous and destructive nonstate actors across the region against the constructive aims of our allies,” who are trying to build a more inclusive region. It is for all these reasons that I believe, hope and pray that a Biden Doctrine for the Middle East is coming — and Israelis should, too. Israel is losing now on three fronts. It has lost the narrative war over Gaza: Even though Hamas murdered and raped Israelis, it is Israel that has gotten hauled before the International Court of Justice in The Hague for the civilian casualties it has caused in Gaza while trying to root out Hamas fighters who embedded among civilians. It is losing the ability to keep Israel safe without being overextended in the long term — by invading Gaza without any plan for how to find a legitimate non-Hamas Palestinian partner to effectively govern there so Israel can pull back. And it is losing on the regional stability front: Israel is now the target of a four-front Iranian onslaught — by Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and Shiite militias in Iraq — but cannot generate the Arab or NATO allies it needs to win that war, because it refuses to do anything to nurture a credible, legitimate Palestinian partner. If a Biden Doctrine emerges, concluded Mousavizadeh, “it will be good geopolitics abroad and good politics at home.” It could deter Iran both militarily and politically — by taking away the Palestinian card from Tehran. It could promote Palestinian statehood on terms consistent with Israeli security and, simultaneously, create the conditions for normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia on terms Palestinians can embrace. And it is a strategy that could work with Arab Americans on Lake Michigan and with Arab allies on the Persian Gulf. It is a strategy that could force a reckoning inside Iranian politics, inside Palestinian politics and inside Israeli politics.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,12,1347,0.551,0.512,0.763,0.23,0.5,0.125,0.507,0.555,0.477,0.5,0.5
171,45316,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,A Titanic Geopolitical Struggle Is Underway,"This article has been updated to reflect new developments. There are many ways to explain the two biggest conflicts in the world today, but my own shorthand has been that Ukraine wants to join the West and Israel wants to join the Arab East — and Russia, with Iran’s help, is trying to stop the first, and Iran and Hamas are trying to stop the second. While the two battlefronts may look very different, they actually have a lot in common. They reflect a titanic geopolitical struggle between two opposing networks of nations and nonstate actors over whose values and interests will dominate our post-post-Cold War world — following the relatively stable Pax Americana/globalization era that was ushered in by the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the collapse of the Soviet bloc, America’s chief Cold War rival. Yes, this is no ordinary geopolitical moment. On one side is the Resistance Network, dedicated to preserving closed, autocratic systems where the past buries the future. On the other side is the Inclusion Network, trying to forge more open, connected, pluralizing systems where the future buries the past. Who wins the struggles between these two networks will determine a lot about the dominant character of this post-post-Cold War epoch. What’s scary is that this clash is widening. On Sunday we saw Iran-backed militiamen from the Resistance Network launch a brazen drone attack on a U.S. military base in Jordan, part of the Inclusion Network, killing three U.S. service members and injuring 25 others. (And in case you’re keeping score at home, China under President Xi Jinping straddles the two networks, along with much of what’s come to be called the global south. Their hearts, and often pocketbooks, are with the Resisters but their heads are with the Includers.) Ukraine is trying to break away from the choking Russian sphere of influence to become part of the European Union. Vladimir Putin is trying to block it, because he knows that if Slavic Ukraine — with its vast engineering talent, land army and agricultural breadbasket — joins the European web, his thieving Slavic autocracy will be more isolated and delegitimized than ever. Putin will not be easily defeated, though, especially with the help of arms from his network allies Iran and North Korea, and passive support from China, Belarus and many members of the global south hungry for his cheap oil. Israel was trying to forge a normalized relationship with Saudi Arabia, which is the gateway to the many Arab Middle East states and Muslim states in South Asia with whom Israel still does not have relations. But it’s not only Israelis who wanted to see El Al planes and Israeli technologists landing in Riyadh. Saudi Arabia, under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, itself aspires to become a giant hub of economic relations that would tie Asia, Africa, Europe, the Arab world — and Israel — into a network centered in Saudi Arabia. His vision is a kind of European Union of the Middle East, with Saudi Arabia playing the anchor the way Germany does with the real E.U. Iran and Hamas want to stop this for joint and separate reasons. Jointly, Hamas and Iran knew that if Israel cemented ties with a newly modernizing Saudi Arabia — on top of Israel’s relations with the United Arab Emirates, Morocco and Bahrain under the Abraham Accords — the balance of power between the secularizing, pluralizing, more market-driven network in the region and the more closed-off, anti-pluralizing, political-Islam-inspired network could tip decisively against both Iran and Hamas, isolating them both. Hamas also does not want to see Israel normalize relations with Saudi Arabia without having to make a single concession to Palestinians in terms of their own aspirations for statehood. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel believed it would be the crowning achievement of his career — and prove all his critics wrong — if he could seal open diplomatic ties with Saudi Arabia, the home of Islam’s holiest sites, without conceding one iota to the Palestinians. This was a reckless goal — Netanyahu should have offered the Palestinians at least some pathway for greater self-rule, if only to make it all easier for Saudi Arabia to sell at home — and Israel is now paying the price. Saudi Arabia says it is still open to normalizing with Israel, but only if Israel gives a firm commitment now for an eventual two-state solution. So don’t let anyone tell you that the wars in Ukraine and Gaza do not matter or are disconnected — or are none of America’s business. These wars very much are our business — and now clearly inescapable, since we’re deeply entwined in both conflicts. What’s crucial to keep in mind about America — as the leader of the Inclusion Network — is that right now we’re fighting the war in Ukraine on our terms, but we’re fighting the war in the Middle East on Iran’s terms. How so? In the Ukraine-Russia war, the Ukrainian Army and people are bearing the full brunt of the conflict — and are ready to continue doing so. All they are asking the United States and its allies for are advanced weapons and financial help. How could we possibly be balking? For tens of billions of dollars, and not a single American soldier killed, Ukraine has inflicted a profound setback to Putin’s army that makes it much less dangerous to the West and to Kyiv. It’s the greatest bargain NATO ever got. CNN recently described, per a source familiar with it, a declassified U.S. intelligence assessment provided to Congress saying that Russia had lost 87 percent of its preinvasion active-duty ground troops and two-thirds of its tanks that it had prior to its invasion of Ukraine.  Putin can still inflict a lot of damage on Ukraine with missiles, but his dream of occupying the whole country and using it as a launching pad to threaten the Inclusion Network — particularly the NATO-protected European Union — is now out of reach. Thank you, Kyiv. At a breakfast with NATO leaders devoted to the Ukraine issue at Davos this year, Canada’s deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland, noted that it is we, the West, who should be thanking the Ukrainians, not forcing them to beg us for more weapons. She also eloquently formulated the stakes: “What Putin wants is to transform the world order” that evolved since World War II and the post-Cold War — where “the competition between nations was about who can be richer and who can help their people prosper the most. … Putin hates that world because he loses in that world — his system is a loser in a peaceful, global, wealth-enhancing paradigm. And so what he wants is to move us back to dog-eat-dog, to a 19th-century, great power competition, because he thinks he can, if not win, be more effective there. … Let’s not think that this is a Ukrainian problem; this is a problem for us all.” She is exactly right. The struggle in the Middle East has different roots, and fascinating ones: The Resistance Network and the Inclusion Network there were born within two months of each other in 1979. The Middle East’s Resistance Network came into being on Feb. 1, 1979, when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini flew into Tehran from Paris, capping an Iranian revolution that ousted the shah and gave birth to the Iranian Islamic Republic that would attempt to export its ideology across the entire Muslim world, while also seeking to drive America out of the region and Israel out of existence. The Middle East’s Inclusion Network was birthed that same year when the U.S. brokered the Egypt-Israel peace treaty, enabling Arab-Israeli collaboration for the first time. Also in 1979, Sheikh Rashid ibn Saeed Al Maktoum — the ruler of the port city of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates — completed Jebel Ali Port, one of the largest in the world, establishing Dubai and the U.A.E. as a global hub that would connect the Arab East — through trade, tourism, services, shipping, investments and world-class airlines — with almost every corner of the planet. In 2015, this Middle East Inclusion Network got a huge boost with the rise in 2015 of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman — with whom I recently met in Riyadh — and his aspiration to transform Saudi Arabia into a giant Dubai on steroids and make it the cultural, investment, conference, tourism and manufacturing center of a much more integrated region. Nadim Koteich, a Lebanese-Emirati political analyst and general manager of Sky News Arabia, who helped me see the contrast between these two networks struggling to shape the Middle East, explained that the Resistance Network “is orchestrated by Iran, Islamists and jihadists” in a process they refer to as the “unity of battlefields.” This network, he noted, “seeks to bridge militias, rejectionists, religious sects and sectarian leaders,” creating an anti-Israel, anti-American, anti-Western axis that can simultaneously pressure Israel in Gaza, in the West Bank and on the Lebanon border — as well as America in the Red Sea, in Syria and in Iraq and Saudi Arabia from all directions. In stark contrast, Koteich said, stands the Inclusion Network, one that’s focused on “weaving together” global and regional markets — instead of battlefronts — business conferences, news organizations, elites, hedge funds, tech incubators and major trade routes. This inclusion network, he added, “transcends traditional boundaries, creating a web of economic and technological interdependence that has the potential to redefine power structures and create new paradigms of regional stability.” So today, while the U.S. is indirectly degrading Russia’s capabilities, through its proxy Ukraine, things are different in the Middle East. There, it is Iran that is sitting back comfortably — indirectly at war with Israel and America, and sometimes Saudi Arabia, by fighting through Tehran’s proxies: Hamas in Gaza, the Houthis in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria, and Shiite militias in Iraq. Iran is reaping all the benefits and paying virtually no cost for the work of its proxies, and the U.S., Israel and their tacit Arab allies have not yet manifested the will or the way to pressure Iran back — without getting into a hot war, which they all want to avoid. My own view is that the best way to deter Iran is by enhancing pressures from the inside — where the Inclusion Network has the most allies: Iran’s young people and their aspirations to be part of the Inclusion Network. How do we know? Because many of Iran’s youth, starved for inclusion, have been in open revolt against the regime since September 2022, when a 22-year-old woman, Mahsa Amini, was arrested in Tehran by Iran’s morality police for allegedly wearing her hijab improperly and then died in custody. A regime under which women die in custody after being arrested for not covering up enough is not a secure or popular regime. Moreover, many educated Iranians know that their regime is just using support for the Palestinian cause as a cover for Iranian imperialism all across the region, where Tehran indirectly controls Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen. Which is why — remarkably — we keep seeing protesters in Iran popping up to express support for Israel since Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack and against Tehran’s costly imperial adventures. Yes, you read that right. “During a game between the football clubs Persepolis and Gol Gohar at the country’s national football stadium, operatives of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps attempted to rally support for the Palestinian cause by waving Palestinian flags on the pitch,” The London Jewish Chronicle reported on Oct. 9, posting the raw footage from X, formerly Twitter. “Instead of sympathy, the Basij — one of the five forces of the I.R.G.C. — was met with chants from fans in the stands to ‘shove that Palestinian flag up your a**!’ Footage of the incident went viral on social media.” It included tweets like: “True Iranians will always support Israel! The Islamic Republic is an occupying force.” The nonpartisan Stimson Center in Washington published a commentary by an Iran-based analyst in October on Iranian opposition to the Hamas attack, which included an amazing Instagram video posted by a prominent Iranian analyst showing Iranian “college students refusing to walk over the flags of the U.S. and Israel which are often placed at the entrance to universities in Iran as a show of support for the Palestinians.” Meanwhile, The Economist reported about Iranian “baristas in cafes” who “pinned stars of David to their aprons.” This attitude is by no means universal; lots of other Iranians surely side with Hamas, especially with the civilian casualties in Gaza. Nevertheless, noted Iran International, an Iranian opposition channel based in London, “ ‘No Gaza, No Lebanon, I shall die for Iran,’ has been a recurring slogan in many protests in Iran.” The members of the Resistance Network are great at tearing down and breaking stuff, but, unlike the Inclusion Network, they have shown no capacity to build any government or society anyone would want to emigrate to, let alone emulate. (The visa line to get into Houthi-run Yemen is not long.) We don’t stress that enough. For all of these reasons, this is a moment of great peril as well as great opportunity — especially for Israel. The competition between the Resistance Network and the Inclusion Network means that the region has never been more hostile or more hospitable to accepting a Jewish state. It is too bad that a traumatized Israel under Netanyahu’s failed leadership can’t see this right now. If Israel could one day agree to a long-term process with a transformed Palestinian Authority to build two states for two peoples, it could decisively tip the balance between the Resistance Network and the Inclusion Network. The Resistance Network would have nothing to justify the wasteful wars it fights and the arms it amasses — supposedly to defeat Israel and America but actually to keep its own people down and itself in power.

172,45310,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,Netanyahu Is Turning Against Biden,"It looks as if President Biden will be running in two races this year: one in America against Donald Trump and one in Israel against Benjamin Netanyahu. Maybe Trump could name Netanyahu his running mate and we could save a lot of time. Biden’s support for the Israeli leader is costing him with his own progressive base, while Netanyahu is now turning on Biden in ways that could win Trump fresh support from right-wing American Jews. Trump-Netanyahu 2024 — that has a certain ring to it, not to mention an air of truth. Why do I say this? Because at a nationally televised news conference on Thursday, Netanyahu made clear something he had only hinted at in recent weeks. Despite the disastrous Hamas attack on Oct. 7 happening on his watch, he is going to frame his campaign to stay in power with this argument: The Americans and the Arabs want to force a Palestinian state down Israel’s throat, and I am the only Israeli leader strong enough to resist them. So vote for me, even if I messed up on Oct. 7 and the Gaza war is not going all that great. Only I can protect us from Biden’s plans for Gaza to become part of a Palestinian state, along with the West Bank, governed by a transformed Palestinian Authority. I know what you’re asking: You mean Netanyahu would actually run for re-election by positioning himself against the American president who flew over to Israel right after Oct. 7, where he put a protective arm around Bibi and the whole Israeli body politic and basically gave Israel a green light to try to destroy Hamas in Gaza, even if it led to thousands of Palestinian civilians’ being killed in the process? You mean to save his own political skin, Netanyahu would actually run on a platform that would guarantee Israel had no American, Palestinian, Arab or European partners to help Israel govern or exit Gaza or get its hostages back? Yes, I am seeing and saying both. Although Israel has been at war with Hamas for over 100 days and still has over 100 hostages to recover, Netanyahu’s No. 1 focus is Netanyahu. He’s searching for the most emotive political message to get him just enough votes from the far right to remain prime minister and stay out of prison, should he lose any of the three corruption cases against him. Let me walk you through the sequence of events that transpired this week that led to this conclusion, as I was a close-up witness to part of them. On Wednesday, I interviewed U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, first offstage for this column and then before a large audience at the Davos World Economic Forum. In the public session I asked him to briefly explain something I had discussed in private with him: why it feels as if Israel is losing on three key fronts and why Israel could turn things around on those fronts if it had a legitimate, effective Palestinian partner. The three fronts where Israel is losing: First, even though Hamas started this war by murdering, maiming, kidnapping and raping Israeli civilians just across the border, Hamas seems to be winning the global narrative war on social media because of the thousands of civilian casualties in Gaza caused by the Israeli bombing of Hamas fighters who had deliberately embedded themselves in tunnels and next to homes of Palestinian civilians. Second, Netanyahu still has not defined a political outcome for Gaza, a plan for keeping the peace and overseeing governance and security, or a legitimate Palestinian partner to help make it all happen. Without that, Israel could be stuck in Gaza forever. And third, Israel is being attacked from afar by pro-Iranian nonstate actors, particularly the Houthis from Yemen and Hezbollah from Lebanon. And the only way for Israel to deter and counter their threats, particularly when it is still tied down fighting in Gaza, is with the help of global and regional allies. The answer to all three challenges, I argued to Blinken at the public session, was for Israel to find and help build a credible, legitimate, effective Palestinian partner, whether that is a reformed version of the current Palestinian Authority based in Ramallah — which has embraced the Oslo peace accord with Israel and worked with Israeli security forces — or some completely new institution named by the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. If the P.L.O. — with the help of the Americans, the Europeans and the pro-American Arab states and the encouragement of Israel — is able to help stand up and sustain an effective Palestinian governing authority that has legitimacy in the eyes of Palestinians, this could answer all three of Israel’s problems. It would seize the narrative from Hamas, Hezbollah and their Iranian backer by proving that Israel was not out for just revenge or conquest in Gaza. It would provide Israel with a political authority to govern Gaza for the long run that Israel could work with to ensure that a defeated Hamas could not come back. And a legitimate Palestinian partner would give cover for a regional alliance of Americans, NATO and pro-Western Arab states that could help deter Hezbollah and confront the Houthis. Right now, only the Americans and the British have been willing to push back on the Houthis for disrupting global shipping and firing rockets at Israel, in part because others are worried about looking to be doing Israel’s bidding while it is hammering Gaza. If Israel were engaged with a Palestinian partner, Iran and its local puppets would be on the defensive, I argued. In response to this argument, Blinken said at our public discussion: “You now have something you didn’t have before, and that is Arab countries and Muslim countries even beyond the region that are prepared to have a relationship with Israel in terms of its integration, its normalization, its security, that they were never prepared to have before and to do things, to give the necessary assurance, to make the necessary commitments and guarantees, so that Israel is not only integrated but it can feel secure.” But the only way to achieve that alliance-in-waiting, Blinken added, is by respecting the “absolute conviction by those countries — one that we share — that this has to include a pathway to a Palestinian state, because you’re not going to get the genuine integration you need, you’re not going to get the genuine security you need, absent that. And of course, to that end as well, a stronger, reformed Palestinian Authority that can more effectively deliver for its own people has to be part of the equation.” If Israel and the U.S. and its Arab allies were to adopt such a regional approach, Blinken said, “all of a sudden, you have a region that’s come together in ways that answer the most profound questions that Israel has tried to answer for years, and what has heretofore been its single biggest concern in terms of security, Iran, is suddenly isolated, along with its proxies, and will have to make decisions about what it wants its future to be.” To that end, the U.S. is working on a two-stage process to present this opportunity to Israel, several officials explained to me. The first stage would be a short-term cease-fire in Gaza that would bring about a return of all the 100-plus Israeli hostages held by Hamas in return for Hamas securing Palestinian prisoners in Israel while allowing for the emergence of local Palestinians to assume administrative governing functions there. The hope, U.S. officials say, is that as Israeli troops moved out — with the promise of eventual Palestinian control — some kind of an Arab multinational force would be prepared to move in. A lot would depend, though, on the state of Hamas’s military forces and whether Hamas’s surviving leaders and maybe some senior fighters would be allowed to go to a third country, one senior U.S. official told me. In the second stage, Palestinians, through the Palestine Liberation Organization, would go through their own process of naming a transitional governing authority — before they hold elections for a permanent one — and the West and Arab states would help this authority build proper institutions, including a security force for Gaza and the West Bank. At the same time, Saudi Arabia would begin a process of normalization of relations with Israel that would culminate when a two-state solution was achieved. If it all sounds a bit fluid, it’s because so much depends on the balance of forces when any cease-fire starts. To make sure Israelis understood how serious this idea was, Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, declared in Davos on Tuesday that Saudi Arabia would “certainly” be prepared to normalize relations with Israel if Israel and the Palestinians concluded a settlement that ended with “a Palestinian state.” All of this public diplomacy is part of a Biden strategy not to oust Netanyahu but to present him with a choice — a choice that the whole Israeli public can see: Netanyahu can either reject any collaboration with Palestinians to end the Gaza conflict and beyond and go down in history as the leader who presided over Oct. 7, or he can work with the U.S., Europe, Saudi Arabia and other Arab states and be the Israeli leader who delivered a Palestinian state able to guarantee Israeli security and opened the road to peace with the Saudis and the wider Muslim world. So this was the important context for Netanyahu’s remarks at the news conference on Thursday evening. He presented himself as the only leader who could protect Israel from this U.S. plan ending with a Palestinian state — while offering no alternative strategy for dealing with Israel’s narrative problem, postwar-Gaza problem or regional problem. “Whoever is talking about the day after Netanyahu,” he said, “is essentially talking about the establishment of a Palestinian state with the Palestinian Authority,” which he fundamentally rejected out of hand. In response to Blinken’s statement that Israel would never enjoy “genuine security"" without a pathway to a Palestinian state, Netanyahu added: “In any future arrangement or in the absence of an arrangement,” Israel must maintain “security control” of all territory west of the Jordan River — meaning Israel, the West Bank and Gaza. “That is a vital condition.” If this contradicts the idea of sovereignty for the Palestinians, he said, “What can you do? I tell this truth to our American friends.” Netanyahu declared that he “would be happy to find Gazans” to deal with health and administrative civil affairs in Gaza and enlist Arab states to help with its rehabilitation, but that this was unlikely to happen until Hamas was eradicated, because any Palestinians who worked with Israel would be afraid to “get a bullet in the head” from the terrorist group. The U.S. view, and the rising view in the Israeli military, is that Israel is far from vanquishing Hamas and unlikely to do so any time soon or at a price to Gazan civilians that the world and Washington can tolerate. Therefore, the key to Gaza’s no longer being a permanent threat and burden to Israel is having an alternative Palestinian governing structure that is viewed as legitimate because it is part of a two-state solution and effective because it has Arab state funding and backing — not killing every last Hamas fighter in Gaza. Netanyahu’s view, however, is this: “We are striving for total victory, not just ‘to strike Hamas’ or ‘to hurt Hamas,’ not ‘another round with Hamas’ but total victory over Hamas.” Let me be clear: Some things are true, even if Netanyahu believes them. Hamas is a terrible organization dedicated to destroying the Jewish state. The Palestinian Authority has been a corrupt and ineffective institution for a long time (although Netanyahu did all he could to hobble it). It needs to get its act together, and Israelis are justifiably wary of trusting it to govern in Gaza. And one reason Israel has lost the global narrative is that cynical countries like South Africa are ready to haul Israel before the International Court of Justice while they ignore the fact that Vladimir Putin has been trying to wipe Ukraine off the map and Iran kills dissidents every day and is indirectly occupying four Arab capitals: Baghdad, Beirut, Damascus and Sana. When Israelis see their country singled out this way, many overlook all the holes in Bibi’s arguments — and the endless occupation of Gaza he is promising them — or even applauded when Netanyahu said Thursday, “The prime minister needs to be able to say no, even to our best friends.” But you don’t need to be a political scientist to see through what Netanyahu is doing here. He is signaling to the right-wing West Bank settlers in his coalition: Stick with me; I will make sure the Palestinians never have a state in Gaza or the West Bank. And he is signaling to the wider Israeli public: I was for total victory in Gaza, and if it is not achieved, it will be because Biden and weakling Israeli politicians stopped me before I could finish the job. This is pure, cynical politics by a leader who knows that he started a war with no endgame and that he has no idea now how to get out of it with a lasting peace that secures Israeli hostages and does not involve a permanent, morally draining Israeli occupation of Gaza. Tellingly, Netanyahu was publicly called out yesterday by a key member of his war cabinet, his former chief of staff Gadi Eisenkot, who declared that Israel needs elections and a more widely trusted government now. Eisenkot, whose son was recently killed in Gaza fighting, said that whoever speaks of the “absolute defeat” of Hamas “is not speaking the truth. … We should not tell stories.” For all those reasons, I was glad to see the Biden administration respond, immediately, that for any U.S. president to be credible and to have the regional allies needed to protect Israel from Iran, he needs to be able to say no to our Israeli friends, too. Or as the State Department’s spokesman Matthew Miller said in an immediate answer to Netanyahu’s remarks: For the Israelis, there is “no way to solve their long-term challenges, to provide lasting security, and there is no way to solve the short-term challenges of rebuilding Gaza and establishing governance in Gaza and providing security for Gaza without the establishment of a Palestinian state.” I totally understand why, after Oct. 7, most Israelis don’t want to even hear the words “Palestinian state.” And I totally understand why Biden, a true friend of Israel, insists on uttering them. Because every trend around Israel is only going to get worse — more nonstate actors, more superempowered angry men with drones from Best Buy, a more powerful Iran, more TikTok haters warped by streaming videos of dead Palestinian babies in Gaza. Forging a legitimate, unified, effective Palestinian partner for a two-state deal with Israel that could defuse those threats may be impossible to achieve, but believing that abandoning any effort to do so is in the long-term interest of the Jewish state is a dangerous illusion. And that is exactly what Netanyahu is peddling for his own cynical purposes. Shame on him. Shame on his enablers.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5,2575,0.225,0.444,0.121,0.538,0.203,0.258,0.364,0.279,0.174,0.5,0.467
173,45289,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,What Is Happening to Our World?,"I’ve been The Times’s foreign affairs columnist since 1995, and one of the most enduring lessons I’ve learned is that there are good seasons and bad seasons in this business, which are defined by the big choices made by the biggest players. My first decade or so saw its share of bad choices — mainly around America’s response to Sept. 11 — but they were accompanied by a lot of more hopeful ones: the birth of democracy in Russia and Eastern Europe, thanks to the choices of Mikhail Gorbachev. The Oslo peace process, thanks to the choices of Yitzhak Rabin and Yasir Arafat. China’s accelerating opening to the world, thanks to the choices of Deng Xiaoping. India’s embrace of globalization, thanks to choices initiated by Manmohan Singh. The expansion of the European Union, the election of America’s first Black president and the evolution of South Africa into a multiracial democracy focused on reconciliation rather than retribution — all the result of good choices from both leaders and led. There were even signs of a world finally beginning to take climate change seriously. On balance, these choices nudged world politics toward a more positive trajectory — a feeling of more people being connected and able to realize their full potential peacefully. It was exciting to wake up each day and think about which one of these trends to get behind as a columnist. For the last few years, though, I’ve felt the opposite — that so much of my work was decrying bad choices made by big players: Vladimir Putin’s tightening dictatorship and aggression, culminating in his brutal invasion of Ukraine; Xi Jinping’s reversal of China’s opening; Israel’s election of the most right-wing government in its history; the cascading effects of climate change; the loss of control over America’s southern border; and, maybe most ominously, an authoritarian drift, not only in European countries like Turkey, Poland and Hungary but in America’s own Republican Party as well. To put it another way: If I think about the three pillars that have stabilized the world since I became a journalist in 1978 — a strong America committed to protecting a liberal global order with the help of healthy multilateral institutions like NATO, a steadily growing China always there to buoy the world economy, and mostly stable borders in Europe and the developing world — all three are being shaken by big choices by big players over the last decade. This is triggering a U.S.-China cold war, mass migrations from south to north and an America that has become more unreliable than indispensable. But that’s not the half of it. Because now that advanced military technologies like drones are readily available, smaller players can wield much more power and project it more widely than ever before, enabling even their bad choices to shake the world. Just look at how shipping companies across the globe are having to reroute their traffic and pay higher insurance rates today because the Houthis, Yemeni tribesmen you never heard about until recently, have acquired drones and rockets and started disrupting sea traffic around the Red Sea and through the Suez Canal. This is why I referred to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as our first true world war, and why I feel that Hamas’s war with Israel is in some ways our second true world war. They are being fought on both physical battlefields and digital ones, with huge global reach and implications. Like farmers in Argentina who were stymied when they suddenly lost their fertilizer supplies from Ukraine and Russia. Like young TikTok users around the world observing, opining, protesting and boycotting global chains, such as Zara and McDonald’s, after being enraged by something they saw on a 15-second feed from Gaza. Like a pro-Israel hacker group claiming credit for shutting down some 70 percent of Iran’s gas stations the other day, presumably in retaliation for Iran’s support for Hamas. And so many more. Indeed, in today’s tightly wired world, it is possible that the war over the Gaza Strip — which is roughly twice the size of Washington, D.C. — could decide the next president in Washington, D.C., as some young Democrats abandon President Biden because of his support for Israel. But before we become too pessimistic, let us remember that these choices are just that: choices. There was nothing inevitable or foreordained about them. People and leaders always have agency — and as observers we must never fall prey to the cowardly and dishonest “well, they had no choice” crowd. Gorbachev, Deng, Anwar el-Sadat, Menachem Begin, George H.W. Bush and Volodymyr Zelensky, to name but a few, faced excruciating choices, but they chose forks in the road that led to a safer and more prosperous world, at least for a time. Others, alas, have done the opposite. To close out the year, it’s through this prism of choices that I want to re-examine the story that has consumed me, and I dare say much of the world, since Oct. 7: the Israel-Hamas war. It was not as inevitable as some want you to think. I began thinking about this a few weeks ago, when I flew to Dubai to attend the United Nations climate summit. If you’ve never been there, the Dubai airport has some of the longest concourses in the world. And when my Emirates flight landed, we parked close to one end of the B concourse — so when I looked out the window I saw lined up in a perfectly symmetrical row some 15 Emirates long-haul passenger jets, stretching far into the distance. And the thought occurred to me: What is the essential ingredient that Dubai has and Gaza lacks? Because both began, in one sense, as the convergence of sand and seawater at crucial intersections of the world. It’s not oil — oil plays only a small role in Dubai’s diversified economy today. And it’s not democracy. Dubai is not a democracy and does not aspire to be one. But people are now flocking to live here from all over the world — its population of more than 3.5 million has surged since the outbreak of Covid. Why? The short answer is visionary leadership. Dubai has benefited from two generations of monarchs in the United Arab Emirates who had a powerful vision of how the U.A.E. in general and the emirate of Dubai in particular could choose to be Arab, modern, pluralistic, globalized and embracing of a moderate interpretation of Islam. Their formula incorporates a radical openness to the world, an emphasis on free markets and education, a ban on extremist political Islam, relatively little corruption, a strong rule of law promulgated from the top down and a relentless commitment to economic diversification, talent recruitment and development. There are a million things one could criticize about Dubai, from labor rights for the many foreign workers who run the place to real estate booms and busts, overbuilding and the lack of a truly free press or freedom of assembly, to name but a few. But the fact that Arabs and others keep wanting to live, work, play and start businesses here indicates that the leadership has converted its intensely hot promontory on the Persian Gulf into one of the world’s most prosperous crossroads for trade, tourism, transport, innovation, shipping and golf — with a skyline of skyscrapers, one over 2,700 feet high, that would be the envy of Hong Kong or Manhattan. And it has all been done in the shadow (and with the envy) of a dangerous Islamic Republic of Iran. When I first visited Dubai in 1980, there were still traditional wooden fishing dhows in the harbor. Today, DP World, the Emirati logistics company, manages cargo logistics and port terminals all over the world. Any of Dubai’s neighbors — Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, Iran and Saudi Arabia — could have done the same with their similar coastlines, but it was the U.A.E. that pulled it off by making the choices it made. I toured the site of the U.N.’s global climate conference with the U.A.E.’s minister of state for international cooperation, Reem al-Hashimy, who oversaw the building of Dubai’s massive 2020 Expo City, which was repurposed to hold the event. In three hours spent walking around, we were stopped at least six or seven times by young Emirati women in black robes in groups of two or three, who asked if I could just step aside for a second while they took selfies with Reem or whether I would be their photographer. She was their rock-star role model — this Harvard- and Tufts-educated, nonroyal woman in a leadership role as a government contractor. Compare that with Gaza, where the role models today are Hamas martyrs in its endless war with Israel. Among the most ignorant and vile things that have been said about this Gaza war is that Hamas had no choice — that its wars with Israel, culminating on Oct. 7 with a murderous rampage, the kidnappings of Israelis as young as 10 months and as old as 86 and the rape of Israeli women, could somehow be excused as a justifiable jailbreak by pent-up males. No. Let’s go to the videotape: In September 2005, Ariel Sharon completed a unilateral withdrawal of all Israeli forces and settlements from Gaza, which Israel occupied in the 1967 war. In short order, Hamas began attacking the crossing points between Gaza and Israel to show that even if Israel was gone, the resistance movement wasn’t over; these crossing points were a lifeline for commerce and jobs, and Israel eventually reduced the number of crossings from six to two. In January 2006, the Palestinians held elections hoping to give the Palestinian Authority legitimacy to run Gaza and the West Bank. There was a debate among Israeli, Palestinian and Bush administration officials over whether Hamas should be allowed to run in the elections — because it had rejected the Oslo peace accords with Israel. Yossi Beilin, one of the Israeli architects of Oslo, told me that he and others argued that Hamas should not be allowed to run, as did many members of Fatah, Arafat’s group, who had embraced Oslo and recognized Israel. But the Bush team insisted that Hamas be permitted to run without embracing Oslo, hoping that it would lose and this would be its ultimate refutation. Unfortunately, for complex reasons, Fatah ran unrealistically high numbers of candidates in many districts, dividing the vote, while the more disciplined Hamas ran carefully targeted slates and managed to win the parliamentary majority. Hamas then faced a critical choice: Now that it controlled the Palestinian parliament, it could work within the Oslo Accords and the Paris protocol that governed economic ties between Israel, Gaza and the West Bank — or not. Hamas chose not to — making a clash between Hamas and Fatah, which supported Oslo, inevitable. In the end, Hamas violently ousted Fatah from Gaza in 2007, killing some of its officials and making clear that it would not abide by the Oslo Accords or the Paris protocol. That led to the first Israeli economic blockade of Gaza — and what would be 22 years of on-and-off Hamas rocket attacks, Israeli checkpoint openings and closings, wars and cease-fires, all culminating on Oct. 7. These were fateful choices. Once Sharon pulled Israel out of Gaza, Palestinians were left, for the first time ever, with total control over a piece of land. Yes, it was an impoverished slice of sand and coastal seawater, with some agricultural areas. And it was not the ancestral home of most of its residents. But it was theirs to build anything they wanted. Had Hamas embraced Oslo and chosen to build its own Dubai, not only would the world have lined up to aid and invest in it; it would have been the most powerful springboard conceivable for a Palestinian state in the West Bank, in the heart of the Palestinian ancestral homeland. Palestinians would have proved to themselves, to Israelis and to the world what they could do when they had their own territory. But Hamas decided instead to make Gaza a springboard for destroying Israel. To put it another way, Hamas had a choice: to replicate Dubai in 2023 or replicate Hanoi in 1968. It chose to replicate Hanoi, whose C? Chi tunnel network served as the launchpad for the ’68 Tet offensive. Hamas is not simply engaged in some pure-as-the-driven-snow anticolonial struggle against Israel. Only Hamas’s useful idiots on U.S. college campuses would believe that. Hamas is engaged in a raw power struggle with Fatah over who will control Gaza and the West Bank, and it’s engaged in a power struggle in the region — alongside other pro-Muslim Brotherhood parties and regimes (like Turkey and Qatar) — against pro-Western monarchies like Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kuwait and the U.A.E. and military-led regimes like Egypt’s. In that struggle, Hamas wanted Gaza isolated and in conflict with Israel because that allowed Hamas to maintain its iron-fisted political and Islamist grip over the strip, forgoing elections and controlling all the smuggling routes in and out, which funded its tunnels and war machine and the lifestyle of its leaders and loyalists — every bit as much as Iran’s Islamic regime today needs its hostility with America to justify its iron grip over Iranian society and the Revolutionary Guard’s control of all of its smuggling. Every bit as much as Hezbollah needs its conflict with Israel to justify building its own army inside Lebanon, controlling its drug smuggling and not permitting any Lebanese government hostile to its interests to govern, no matter who is elected. And every bit as much as Vladimir Putin needs his conflict with NATO to justify his grip on power, the militarization of Russian society and his and his cronies’ looting of the state coffers. This is now a common strategy for consolidating and holding power forever by a single political faction and disguising it with an ideology of resistance. It’s no wonder they all support one another. There is so much to criticize about Israel’s occupation of the West Bank, which I have consistently opposed. But please, spare me the Harvard Yard nonsense that this war is all about the innocent, colonized oppressed and the evil, colonizing oppressors; that Israel alone was responsible for the isolation of Gaza; and that the only choice Hamas had for years was to create an underground “skyline” of tunnels up to 230 feet deep (contra Dubai) and that its only choice on Oct. 7 was martyrdom. Hamas has never wavered from being more interested in destroying the Jewish state than in building a Palestinian state — because that goal of annihilating Israel is what has enabled Hamas to justify its hold on power indefinitely, even though Gaza has known only economic misery since Hamas seized control. We do those Palestinians who truly want and deserve a state of their own no favors by pretending otherwise. Gazans know the truth. Fresh polling data reported by AFP indicates that on the eve of Oct. 7, “many Gazans were hostile to Hamas ahead of the group’s brutal Oct. 7 attack on Israel, with some describing its rule as a second occupation.” As Hamas’s grip over Gaza is loosened, I predict we will hear a lot more of these Gazan voices on what they really think of Hamas, and it will be embarrassing to Hamas’s apologists on U.S. campuses. But our story about agency and choices does not stop there. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister — 16 years — also made choices. And even before this war, he made terrible ones — for Israel and for Jews all over the world. The list is long: Before this war, Netanyahu actively worked to keep the Palestinians divided and weak by strengthening Hamas in Gaza with billions of dollars from Qatar, while simultaneously working to discredit and delegitimize the more moderate Palestinian Authority in Ramallah, committed to Oslo and nonviolence in the West Bank. That way Netanyahu could tell every U.S. president, in effect: I’d love to make peace with the Palestinians, but they are divided, and moreover, the best of them can’t control the West Bank and the worst of them control Gaza. So what do you want from me? Netanyahu’s goal has always been to destroy the Oslo option once and for all. In that, Bibi and Hamas have always needed each other: Bibi to tell the United States and Israelis that he had no choice, and Hamas to tell Gazans and its new and naïve supporters around the world that the Palestinians’ only choice was armed struggle led by Hamas. The only exit from this mutually assured destruction is to bring in some transformed version of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank — or a whole new P.L.O.-appointed government of Palestinian technocrats — in partnership with moderate Arab states like Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. But when I raise that with many Israelis right now, they tell me, “Tom, it’s not the time. No one wants to hear it.” That makes me want to scream: No, it is exactly the time. Don’t they get it? Netanyahu’s greatest political achievement has been to persuade Israelis and the world that it’s never the right time to talk about the morally corrosive occupation and how to help build a credible Palestinian partner to take it off Israel’s hands. He and the settlers wore everyone down. When I covered the State Department in the early 1990s, West Bank settlements were routinely described by U.S. officials as “obstacles to peace.” But that phrase was gradually dropped. The Trump administration even decided to stop calling the West Bank “occupied” territory. The reason I insist on talking about these choices now is because Israel is being surrounded by what I call Iran’s landcraft carriers (as opposed to our aircraft carriers): Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and Shiite militias in Iraq. Iran is squeezing Israel into a multifront war with its proxies. I truly worry for Israel. But Israel will have neither the sympathy of the world that it needs nor the multiple allies it needs to confront this Iranian octopus, nor the Palestinian partners it needs to govern any post-Hamas Gaza, nor the lasting support of its best friend in the world, Joe Biden, unless it is ready to choose a long-term pathway for separating from the Palestinians with an improved, legitimate Palestinian partner. Biden has been shouting that in Netanyahu’s ears in their private calls. For all these reasons, if Netanyahu keeps refusing because, once again, politically, the time is not right for him, Biden will have to choose, too — between America’s interests and Netanyahu’s. Netanyahu has been out to undermine the cornerstone of U.S. Middle East policy for the last three decades — the Oslo framework of two states for two people that guarantees Palestinian statehood and Israeli security, which neither side ever gave its best shot. Destroying the Oslo framework is not in America’s interest. In sum, this war is so ugly, deadly and painful, it is no wonder that so many Palestinians and Israelis want to just focus on survival and not on any of the choices that got them here. The Haaretz writer Dahlia Scheindlin put it beautifully in a recent essay: The situation today is so terrible that people run from reality as they run from rockets — and hide in the shelter of their blind spots. It’s pointless to wag fingers. The only thing left to do is try and change that reality. For me, choosing that path will always be in season.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6,3266,0.097,0.708,0.157,0.353,0.269,0.227,0.188,0.425,0.205,0.5,0.213
174,45282,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,It’s Time for the U.S. to Give Israel Some Tough Love,"It is time for the Biden administration to give Israel more than just gentle nudges about how it would be kind of, sort of nice if Israel could fight this war in Gaza without killing thousands of civilians. It’s time for the U.S. to stop wasting time searching for the perfect U.N. cease-fire resolution on Gaza. It’s time for the U.S. to tell Israel that its war’s aim of wiping Hamas off the face of the earth is not going to be achieved — at least not at a cost that the U.S. or the world will tolerate, or that Israel should want. It’s time for the U.S. to tell Israel how to declare victory in Gaza and go home, because right now the Israeli prime minister is utterly useless as a leader: He is — unbelievably — prioritizing his own electoral needs over the interests of Israelis, not to mention the interests of Israel’s best friend, President Biden. It’s time for the U.S. to tell Israel to put the following offer on the table to Hamas: total Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, in return for all the Israeli hostages and a permanent cease-fire under international supervision, including U.S., NATO and Arab observers. And no exchange of Palestinians in Israeli jails. What would the advantages of this approach be for Israel? First, if I am reading the mood in Israel correctly these days, the overwhelming majority of the country today wants their 120-plus hostages returned — over and above any other war aims. Israel is a small country. Many, many Israelis know someone — or know someone who knows someone — with a loved one taken hostage or killed in Gaza. The hostage issue is making Israelis crazy, for good reason, and it’s making rational military decision-making there impossible — especially as many experts believe the Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar has now surrounded himself with Israeli hostages as human shields and it will be impossible to kill him without also killing many of them. Any Israeli government that does that would sow the wind and reap the whirlwind of wrath from the Israeli public. Second, Israel has inflicted vast damage on Gaza’s main urban areas and on Hamas’s tunnel network and killed thousands of Hamas fighters, along with, tragically, thousands of the Gazan civilians among whom Hamas embedded itself. Hamas as a military organization deserved to be punished and pummeled, and it has been considerably degraded. But that huge toll of killed, wounded and displaced Gazan civilians has produced a humanitarian disaster. And Israel has no plan — indeed, has not had a plan since the start of the war — for how this humanitarian crisis will be managed and remediated, and how to induce non-Hamas Palestinians and Arabs to come forward and partner with Israel to repair and run a postwar Gaza. There is also increasing discomfort in the Israel Defense Forces leadership over the fact that it is being asked by the far-right government of Benjamin Netanyahu to fight a war in Gaza without a clearly defined political objective, timetable or mechanism to win and hold the peace. My view: Israel should just get out and let the person who started this terrible war, knowing but not caring that it would lead to the death and destruction of thousands of innocent Gazans, manage the cleanup. And that is the Hamas leader, Sinwar. The best way to discredit and destroy Sinwar is for Israel to leave Gaza and make him come out of his tunnel, face his people and the world and own Gaza’s rebuilding on his own. I can tell you from experience what I think will happen. On the first day, Sinwar will strut around the rubble of Gaza like a peacock, declaring how he and his men inflicted terrible damage on the Jews, and supporters will carry him on their shoulders, shouting “Allahu akbar.” On Day 2, with the Israelis gone, they will scream at Sinwar publicly and privately: What were you thinking? Who gave you permission to launch this war? Who is going to repair my home? Who is going to bring back my loved ones? How are you going to get any help rebuilding Gaza if you keep on lobbing missiles at Tel Aviv? You thought Hezbollah, the West Bankers, Israeli Arabs and Iran would all jump full-scale into this war and rise up against the Jews. It didn’t happen — except at some American colleges — and now all we have are ruins and the dead. How do I know that will happen? Because it’s what happened in Lebanon in 2006, when Hassan Nasrallah foolishly launched an unprovoked war against Israel, leading to enormous destruction in Shiite villages both in the south and around Beirut. How do I know that will happen? Because it is already happening. Consider this Bloomberg report from Dec. 11: Since the war, life in Gaza — which never was easy — has become unbearable. And while most Palestinians are furious at Israel, some are also expressing anger at Hamas, which has ruled the strip since 2007, when it threw out the Palestinian Authority through a brief and violent civil war. “Hand over the hostages and stop the war,” Rahaf Hneideq, a Gaza-based professor of Islamic studies, wrote to Hamas on Facebook. “Enough death, enough destruction. Stop the displacement. Don’t your people deserve that?” How do I know that will happen? Because while polls conducted by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research show support for Hamas growing in the West Bank since Oct. 7 — which are really signs of contempt for the Palestinian Authority and antipathy to the violent Jewish settlers — support for Hamas in Gaza, which usually rises during wars, has not significantly increased. Moreover, despite the increase in Hamas popularity in the West Bank, “the majority in both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip does not support Hamas,” Khalil Shikaki, the director of the P.C.P.S.R., found. And if you follow news of Hamas politics, you will have noticed reports this week of significant tension between Sinwar and Hamas leaders abroad, who have begun — to Sinwar’s apparent rage — talks with leaders from the West Bank Palestinian Authority about reunifying and revamping the Palestinian leadership after the war to enable some kind of long-term peace arrangement with Israel. Israel has a choice: It can own Gaza’s future forever, with Israel’s completely dysfunctional relationship between the army and the far-right cabinet, which will never agree on collaborating with any Palestinian Authority, leading to Israel inheriting one of the worst humanitarian disasters on the planet. Or it can get out now, get back its hostages and let Sinwar and his friends own that problem — as they should. Let Hamas have to tell Gazans that there will be no rebuilding, just more of its endless war to destroy the Jews. Let’s see how long that lasts. And if Hamas tries that, let the U.S. and its allies show the whole world that there is only one reason Gazans are dying another day longer, and that it is because Hamas won’t accept a cease-fire. From the start of this war, there has been an asymmetry: Israel, a democracy, has to answer every day for its actions and mistakes and excesses. Sinwar has never had to for a minute. Time to turn the tables. And speaking of turning the tables — Iran, Hezbollah and the Houthis pray five times a day for one thing: that Israel will stay in Gaza forever. They want Israel militarily, economically, diplomatically and morally overstretched. The absolute worst news they could get is to hear that Israel is offering total withdrawal for a return of all hostages and an internationally monitored cease-fire that will include U.S. and NATO supervision. And the absolute worst news that Russia and China could get is that Biden arranged this end to the war. Indeed, Hezbollah will go into immediate panic mode, saying to itself: Do you mean that if we now keep shelling northern Israel we will face the total, undivided wrath of the Israeli Army and Air Force and lose all justification for our attacks on Israel? Ditto the Houthis. Israel has done enormous damage to Hamas’s military infrastructure, but at a cost to innocent civilians in Gaza that cannot be morally or strategically justified any longer. Offering Hamas a total withdrawal and internationally monitored cease-fire — in return for all hostages — will shift all of the political, military, diplomatic and moral pressure onto Sinwar. And it won’t just be for one day, but for the future. I also have no doubt that the Israeli Army can fortify its Gaza border, apply all the lessons of its pre-Oct. 7 mistakes and make sure Hamas can never smuggle in the arms that it did again. No, it is not the fairy-tale ending Israelis may have hoped for after Oct. 7 — a Gaza Strip utterly free of any trace of Hamas, permanently controlled by Israel and some totally compliant fantasy Palestinian partner and all the reconstruction paid for by the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia. But that was always a fairy tale. Perfect is never on the table in Gaza. Israel needs to coolly, rationally think through its options, and the Biden administration needs to stop whispering quietly that Israel should reconsider its war aims and tactics. The Biden team needs to engage Israelis in a loud, blunt, no-holds-barred discussion about how much it has already achieved militarily, how best to consolidate those gains and how to end this war with some kind of new balance of power in Israel’s favor — before Israel sinks itself into the quicksand of Gaza, chasing a perfect victory that is a mirage.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,11,1623,0.463,0.254,0.224,0.101,0.5,0.166,0.239,0.209,0.243,0.5,0.5
175,45272,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,What Worries Me About the Gaza War After My Trip to Arab States,"I’ve been concerned from the start that Israel launched its invasion of Gaza to eradicate Hamas with no plan for what to do with the territory and its people in the wake of any victory. Having just spent a week in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates taking the pulse of this important corner of the Arab world, I am now even more worried. Let me summarize my concerns this way: Because Hamas built a vast tunnel network under Gaza, Israeli forces, in their quest to eliminate that vicious terrorist organization, are having to destroy huge numbers of structures. It’s the only way they can kill a lot of Hamas fighters and demilitarize Gaza without losing a lot of their own soldiers in the short window that Israel feels it has in the face of pressure from the U.S. and other allies to wind down the invasion. Israel was justified in hitting back at Hamas for breaking the cease-fire that existed on Oct. 7 and indiscriminately murdering, raping or maiming more than 1,200 people and kidnapping some 240 others in its path that day. Hamas plotted and executed a campaign of unspeakable barbarism that seemed designed to make Israel crazy and lash out without thinking about the morning after the morning after. And that is just what Israel did. But nine weeks later, we can now see the morning after the morning after. In pursuing its aims of dismantling Hamas’s military machine and wiping out its top leaders, Israel has killed and wounded thousands of innocent Gazan civilians. Hamas knew this would happen and did not care a whit. Israel must. It will inherit responsibility for a gigantic humanitarian disaster that will require a global coalition years to fix and manage. As The Times reported on Tuesday, “Satellite imagery shows that the fighting has resulted in heavy damage to almost every corner of Gaza City” — at least 6,000 buildings hammered, with about a third of them in ruins. A recent essay on this subject in Haaretz by David Rosenberg noted that “even if the fighting ends in a decisive victory over Hamas, Israel will be saddled with a problem that almost defies solution. Most of the public discussion about what happens the day after the war has focused on who will govern Gaza. That alone is a knotty question, but the problem goes much deeper than who will be responsible for law and order and providing basic services: Whoever is in charge will have to rebuild the wreckage that is Gaza and create a functioning economy.” That will be a multibillion-dollar, multiyear endeavor. And I can tell you based on my conversations here, no Gulf Arab states (not to mention European Union states or the U.S. Congress) are going to come into Gaza with bags of money to rebuild it unless — and even this is not a sure thing — Israel has a legitimate, effective Palestinian partner and commits to one day negotiating a two-state solution. Any Israeli official who says otherwise is delusional. “We need to see a viable two-state solution plan, a road map that is serious before we talk about the next day and rebuilding the infrastructure of Gaza,” Lana Nusseibeh, the United Arab Emirates ambassador to the United Nations, said in an interview Tuesday with The Wall Street Journal. The most hopeful thing I can report from Riyadh, and from talking to U.S. officials in Washington before I arrived, is that when the war in Gaza ends, Saudi Arabia remains committed in principle to resuming the negotiations that were underway before Oct. 7. What the negotiators were discussing was a grand bargain in which the U.S. would enter into a security treaty with Saudi Arabia and, at the same time, Saudi Arabia would normalize relations with Israel — provided that Israel committed to defined steps to work with the Palestinian Authority toward a two-state solution. But I was left with the very strong impression here that the Saudis want the Americans to shut down the Gaza war as soon as possible, because the death and destruction in Gaza are radicalizing their young population (who were, by and large, not focused on Israel-Palestine before), while frightening away foreign investors and generally getting in the way of what Saudi Arabia wants to focus on: Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030 plan for transforming the country, from education to infrastructure to women’s empowerment. While the leaders here are not the least bit sympathetic to Hamas, and would not mourn the group’s disappearance for a second, they are dubious that Israel can wipe Hamas out forever and worried that, in trying to do so, the damage to Gaza will set off unintended bad consequences. Of course I understand why reviving this Saudi-U.S.-Israel-Palestinian dialogue would be hard for even a moderate Israeli government to commit to right now — let alone the collection of fanatics currently running Israel, who are committed to annexing the West Bank and the craziest of whom even look longingly on adding Gaza. And given what happened on Oct. 7, not a lot of Israelis want to even think about, let alone agree to, ceding territorial control to any Palestinian governing authority. But if Israel does not come up with a long-term political vision to entice the world to help it fund the rebuilding of Gaza, it is going to be in for a lot of diplomatic and economic hurt. Gaza could end up a giant, sucking chest wound that overstretches Israel militarily, economically and morally — and takes its U.S. superpower patron along for the ride. Yes, along for the ride …. Bibi Netanyahu is campaigning right now to keep his job by trying to prove to his far-right base that he is the only leader ready to tell the Biden administration to its face that his country will never do the minimum that the U.S. is asking: for Israel to help nurture a revamped Palestinian Authority, and to offer some long-term political horizon for Palestinian statehood in order to develop a Palestinian partner that can one day govern a Gaza liberated from Hamas and Israel. It is why Saudi Arabia’s willingness — if it holds — to proceed with the U.S.-Saudi-Israeli-Palestinian dialogue when this war stops is so important. But this is not just some act of charity by the Saudis. This is a hard-core strategy. This generation of leaders in Saudi Arabia as well as in the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco (three countries that signed the Abraham Accords with Israel) is quite unsentimental when it comes to the Palestinian-Israel conflict. Although it’s complicated. These leaders are fed up with being told they have to postpone their priorities and focus their energy, attention and resources on the Palestinian cause. At the same time, though, they are genuinely horrified at the civilian losses in Gaza. At the same time, they are keenly aware of the corruption and general incompetence of the Palestinian Authority. And at the same time, they detest the Muslim Brotherhood offshoots like Hamas and understand how its sympathizers around the region, with the ever-cynical help of Iran, are trying to use the images of dead babies in Gaza on television and social media to inflame Arab populations. Western diplomats and Saudi officials pointed out to me how all of these political crosswinds are howling today in nasty inter-Arab battles going on in Arabic social media over the Palestine issue. This was especially true after Prince Mohammed, in an interview with Fox News in September, expressed enthusiasm about normalizing relations with Israel if it would move toward a solution with the Palestinians. (I believe this Saudi willingness was, indeed, a key reason Hamas attacked on Oct. 7.) For instance, when Saudi Arabia went ahead on Oct. 28 with its annual entertainment and sports festival known as Riyadh Season — which features widely attended sports matches by prominent athletes and performances by Arab and international singers, dancers and other artists — pro-Palestinian social media influencers largely from Kuwait and Egypt began trashing Saudis for having fun while Gaza was burning. Posts contrasting images of cultural performances in Riyadh with Palestinians being bombed in Gaza began to proliferate, much to the annoyance of Saudis, plenty of whom are as enraged by the deaths of so many Gazan civilians as any other Arabs. The Daily Mail Australia reported that at the Nov. 21 soccer World Cup qualifier match in Kuwait between the Palestinian and Australian teams, Palestinian fans “staged a protest against Israel’s actions in the Gaza Strip.” On the seventh minute of the game, they raised Palestinian flags and waved Palestinian head scarfs, kaffiyehs, “to mark the start of the war on 7 Oct. — the date of the Hamas attack inside Israel.” That seventh-minute protest was not only a declaration of support for Hamas but also perceived as a dig at the Saudis, one official here explained to me. The Portuguese soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo now plays for the Saudi team Al-Nassr. Ronaldo wears No. 7 — and at the seven-minute mark of games Al-Nassr fans let out a huge cheer for him. Two weeks ago, Saudi Arabia hosted the second preliminary regatta of the 37th America’s Cup at the Jeddah yacht club on the Red Sea coast, while Houthi pirates from Yemen were attacking Israeli-owned ships in that same Red Sea and Houthi militiamen were firing rockets at Israel. While all of this was going on overhead and on the ocean, an American friend of mine attending the regatta said one of his Saudi hosts was berating him about U.S. support for the destruction of Gaza. It’s complicated. And yet: I was walking in the Faisaliah mall Monday when a middle-aged shopkeeper who recognized me walked out of his women’s clothing store to say hello. He talked about all the business opportunities that were opening up in Saudi Arabia. Our conversation, though, quickly turned to Gaza, and he wanted to make sure I understood that many Saudis did not support Hamas, because its mass murder of civilians and abduction of children in war was expressly banned by the Prophet Muhammad and was done at the behest of Iran. The good news: A few months ago, the Saudi government did a private poll asking Saudis how they felt about normalization with Israel — if it were done in the context of Saudi support for Palestinian statehood. Seventy percent approved, a senior official told me. The bad news: Given the images coming out of Gaza now, he added, the government wouldn’t dare conduct that poll today.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,13,1766,0.185,0.074,0.407,0.546,0.546,0.1,0.118,0.382,0.131,0.5,0.5
176,45261,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,The Debate That Israel Needs Over the War,"As Israel debates what to do next in Gaza, I hope Israel’s political-military leadership will reflect on the adage often attributed to Confucius: “Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves” — one for your enemy and one for yourself. Wise man, Confucius. The reason I was so wary about Israel invading Gaza with the aim of totally eliminating Hamas was certainly not out of any sympathy for Hamas, which has been a curse on the Palestinian people even more than on Israel. It was out of a deep concern that Israel was acting out of blind rage, aiming at an unattainable goal — wiping Hamas from the face of the earth as one of its ministers advocated — and with no plan for the morning after. In doing so Israel could get stuck in Gaza forever — owning all its pathologies and having to govern its more than two million people amid a humanitarian crisis, and even worse, discrediting the very Israeli military that it was trying to restore Israelis’ trust in. Quite honestly, I thought back to America after 9/11. And I asked myself, what do I wish I had done more of before we launched two wars of revenge and transformation in Afghanistan and Iraq for which they and we paid a huge price? I wish I’d argued for what the C.I.A. calls a “Red Cell” or “Red Team” — a group of intelligence officers outside the direct military or political chain of command, whose main job would have been to examine the war plans and goals for Iraq and Afghanistan and stress-test them by proposing contrarian alternatives for achievable goals to restore U.S. security and deterrence. And to have that Red Team’s recommendations be made public before we went to war. As a retired senior U.S. intelligence official said to me: The role of the C.I.A.’s Red Cell on other thorny problems “was to help the U.S. government make decisions with eyes wide open and to buy down, but not eliminate, risk. It’s not a sign of weakness to make fully informed decisions and I think the Red Cell is a great tool for weighing alternative options and potential second- and third-order effects. Israel’s leaders need to be rigorous and not only passionate at this moment in time.” So it’s with that in mind that I am proposing Israel create not only a Red Team for how to deal with Hamas in Gaza but also a Blue Team to critique the Red Team. Israel needs to have a much more robust internal debate because it has clearly rushed into a war with multiple contradictory goals. Israel’s stated aim is to get back all its remaining hostages — now more than 130 soldiers and civilians — while destroying Hamas and its infrastructure once and for all, while doing it in a way that doesn’t cause more Gazan civilian casualties than the Biden administration can defend, and without leaving Israel responsible for Gaza forever and having to pay its bills every day. Good luck with all that. Here’s what an Israeli Red Team might point out and advocate instead. For starters, because the military and cabinet rushed into Gaza in this war and seemingly never game-planned for any endgame, Israel now finds itself in a difficult predicament. It has pushed well over one million civilians from northern Gaza to the south to get them away from the fight as it has attempted to wipe out all Hamas fighters in Gaza City and its environs. But now, the only way that Israel can take the ground war to southern Gaza — around Khan Younis, where Hamas’s senior leadership is suspected of hiding in tunnels — is by moving through this mass of displaced people and by creating even more. Facing this predicament, the Israeli Red Team would suggest a radical alternative: Israel should call for a permanent cease-fire that would be followed by an immediate Israeli withdrawal of all military forces in Gaza on the condition that Hamas return all the hostages it has left, civilians and military, and any dead. But Hamas would get no Palestinian prisoners in return. Just a clean deal — Israeli withdrawal and a permanent cease-fire in return for the 130-plus Israeli hostages. There would be an Israeli asterisk, though, which wouldn’t be written in, but everyone would understand it is there: Israel reserves the right in the future to bring to justice the top Hamas leaders who planned this massacre. As it did after the Munich massacre, though, Israel will do that with a scalpel, not a hammer. What might be the advantages of such a strategy for Israel? The Red Team would cite five. First, it would argue, all the pressure for a cease-fire to spare Gazan civilians more death and destruction will fall on Hamas, not on Israel. Let Hamas tell its people living out in the cold and rain — and the world — that it will not agree to a cease-fire for the mere humanitarian price of returning all the Israeli hostages. Moreover, Israel would have ensured that Hamas got no big political victory out of this war like forcing Israel to free all the more than 6,000 Palestinians in its jails in return for the hostages Hamas is holding. No, no — it would just be a clean deal: permanent cease-fire for Israeli hostages, period. The world can understand that. Let’s see Hamas reject it and declare that it wants more war. Second, some, maybe many, in Israel would complain that the military did not achieve its stated objective of eliminating Hamas, therefore it was a Hamas victory. The Red Team would respond that, for starters, the objective was unrealistic, especially with a right-wing Israeli government unwilling to work with the more moderate Palestinian Authority in the West Bank to build an alternative to Hamas to run Gaza. What Israel will have achieved, the Red Team would argue, is to have sent a powerful message of deterrence to Hamas and to Hezbollah in Lebanon: You destroy our villages, we will destroy yours 10 times more. This is ugly stuff, but the Middle East is a Hobbesian jungle. It is not Scandinavia. And think smart about it: In the wake of such a permanent cease-fire, Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’s leader, would have to come out of his tunnel, squint into the sun, and face his own people for the first time since this war started. Yes, the morning after he comes out, many Gazans will carry him on their shoulders and sing his name for dealing such a heavy blow to the Jews. But on the morning after the morning after, the Red Team would predict, many of those carrying him around would begin whispering to him: “Sinwar, what were you thinking? My house is now a pile of rubble. Who is going to rebuild it? My job in Israel that was feeding my family of 10 is gone. How am I going to feed my kids? You need to get me some international humanitarian assistance and a new house and job — and how are you going to do that if you keep lobbing rockets at the Jews?” With Israel out, the humanitarian crisis created by this war in Gaza would become Sinwar’s and Hamas’s problem — as it should be. Every problem in Gaza would be Sinwar’s fault, starting with jobs. Keep in mind, as Reuters recently noted, that before Oct. 7 Israel was issuing “more than 18,000 permits allowing Gazans to cross into Israel and the Israeli-occupied West Bank to take jobs in sectors like agriculture or construction that typically carried salaries up to 10 times what a worker could earn” in Gaza. Gaza was also exporting over $130 million a year of fish, agricultural produce, textiles and other products to Israel and the West Bank. That’s now all stopped. Third, the Israeli Red Team would argue, this will create the same kind of deterrence for Hamas that Israel’s devastating bombardments of pro-Hezbollah communities in the southern suburbs of Beirut did in the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has never dared to provoke a full-scale war with Israel since. The Red Team would add that not only would the damage Israel has inflicted on Hamas and Gaza create similar deterrence, but so too would the fact that Israel could now reimagine and strengthen its own border defenses. Hamas has shown Israel where all its vulnerabilities were and how it smuggled in so many weapons — and Israel can now make sure this will never happen again. Fourth, one of the biggest strategic benefits of Israel getting out of Gaza in return for an internationally monitored cease-fire is that it could then devote full attention to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah and Iran would not like that. They want Israel permanently militarily overstretched and forced to keep a good chunk of its 300,000-plus reservists — who drive its economy — permanently mobilized to govern Gaza. They also want Israel’s economy permanently overstretched to pay for it. And they want Israel morally overstretched by permanently owning the Gaza humanitarian crisis, so that every day the sun did not shine in Gaza, the rain did not fall, the electricity did not flow, the world would say that it is Israel’s fault. Israel’s worst enemies could not design a worse fate for it — and that is what Hezbollah and Iran are praying for. Finally, the Israeli Red Team would argue, Israel has important healing to do at home. This surprise attack happened because Israel had a prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who had fractured the country by trying to mount an insane judicial coup and who governed Israel for a total of 16 years with a strategy of dividing everyone — religious from secular, left from right, Ashkenazim from Sephardim, Israeli Arabs from Israeli Jews — weakening the country’s immune system. Israel can be healed internally and resume its project of normalizing relations with its Arab neighbors and forging a stable relationship with the more moderate Palestinian leadership in the West Bank only if Netanyahu is removed. If the war goes on forever, that will never happen. And that is exactly what Netanyahu wants. But now comes the Israeli Blue Team. What would it say about the Red Team? Well, first, it would ask, what do you do if Sinwar simply says no, I won’t accept just a cease-fire, I need my 6,000-plus prisoners out of Israeli jails and I will pay the price in Western public opinion to hold out for them? Then Israel is stuck again. The Israeli Blue Team would say: We have a better idea. First, downgrade our objectives. Declare that the military’s objective is not to wipe Hamas off the face of the earth, but to significantly diminish its fighting capacity. Because, the Blue Team would say, we actually don’t believe in deterrence. Hezbollah has not really been deterred since 2006. That is an illusion. Iran is just saving Hezbollah for the day Israel will threaten its nuclear program. We Blue Teamers believe in constantly diminishing our enemies’ capabilities. Once we have greatly diminished Hamas’s capabilities, we are not going to stay in Gaza forever until we kill every leader. Instead, we will pull back and create a perimeter and outposts one mile inside the Gaza-Israel border to ensure that our border communities can never again be attacked overland as they were on Oct. 7. And we will do that to emphasize that we have the abilities and intentions to return at will if Hamas keeps firing rockets at us. If Hamas wants to trade our hostages for prisoners, we can talk. As for governance of Gaza, a diminished Hamas can stay in charge if that is what Gazans want. Let Hamas be responsible for the water and electricity. Finally, the Blue Team would say to the Israeli political leadership: “Stop lying to yourself and the public. If we try to conquer and hold all of Gaza, Gaza will not only swallow us in the end, you politicians will create huge doubts in the public’s mind about the military by giving it an unachievable goal and Israel simply cannot afford more doubts about the military a second longer.” In sum, Israel needs this kind of internal debate, where an Israeli Red Team and Blue Team can remind the country’s leadership that there is no perfect outcome waiting for Israel in Gaza. Fixing Gaza “once and for all” was always a fantasy. But here is what is not a fantasy: The true history of Israel-Hamas relations. It is very simple. It is war, timeout, war, timeout, war, timeout, war, timeout …. Hamas thrives in the wars, because that is all it can deliver and all that it exists for. Israel thrives in the long timeouts — in the cease-fires — when all of its societal, economic and innovative strengths come to the fore. Iran, Hamas and Hezbollah want to drag Israel into a permanent state of war. Israel needs a Red Team and a Blue Team to advocate instead for longer cease-fires, a more hardened border and the flexibility to return to Gaza if Hamas forces it to. Not perfect, but perfect was never on the menu. It’s the Middle East, Jake.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,8,2220,0.413,0.45,0.137,0.137,0.5,0.128,0.359,0.149,0.353,0.5,0.5
177,45258,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,Understanding the True Nature of the Hamas-Israel War,"The reason the Hamas-Israel war can be hard for outsiders to understand is that three wars are going on at the same time: a war between Israeli Jews and the Palestinians exacerbated by a terrorist group, a war within Israeli and Palestinian societies over the future and a war between Iran and its proxies and America and its allies. But before we dig into those wars, here’s the most important thing to keep in mind about them: There’s a single formula that can maximize the chances that the forces of decency can prevail in all three. It is the formula that I think President Biden is pushing, even if he can’t spell it all out publicly now — and we should all push it with him: You should want Hamas defeated, as many Gazan civilians as possible spared, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his extremist allies booted, all the hostages returned, Iran deterred and the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank reinvigorated in partnership with moderate Arab states. Pay particular attention to that last point: A revamped Palestinian Authority is the keystone for the forces of moderation, coexistence and decency triumphing in all three wars. It is the keystone for reviving a two-state solution. It is the keystone for creating a stable foundation for the normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia and the wider Arab Muslim world. And it is the keystone for creating an alliance among Israel, moderate Arabs, the United States and NATO that can weaken Iran and its proxies Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis — all of whom are up to no good. Unfortunately, as Haaretz’s military correspondent, Amos Harel, reported on Tuesday, Netanyahu “is locked in by the extreme right and the settlers, who are fighting an all-out war against the idea of any involvement of the Palestinian Authority in Gaza mainly out of fear that the United States and Saudi Arabia will exploit such a move to restart the political process and push for a two-state solution in a way that will require Israel to make concessions in the West Bank.” So Netanyahu, “under pressure from his political partners, has banned any discussion of this option.” If Netanyahu is a captive of his political right, Biden needs to be very careful not to become a captive of Bibi. That is no way to win these three wars at once. The first and most obvious of the three is the latest round of the century-long battle between two indigenous peoples — Jews and Palestinians — over the same land but now with a twist: This time the Palestinian side is not being led by the Palestinian Authority, which since Oslo has been committed to reaching a two-state solution based on the borders that existed before the 1967 war. It’s being led by Hamas, a militant Islamist organization dedicated to eradicating any Jewish state. On Oct. 7, Hamas embarked on a war of annihilation. The only maps it carried were not of a two-state solution but of how to find the most people in the Israeli kibbutzim and kill or kidnap as many of them as possible. While I have no doubt that ending Hamas’s rule in Gaza — something every Sunni Arab regime except Qatar is quietly rooting for — is necessary to give both Gazans and Israelis hope for a better future, the whole Israeli war effort will be delegitimized and become unsustainable unless Israel can do it with much greater care for the Palestinian civilians. The Hamas invasion and the rushed Israeli counterinvasion are unleashing a humanitarian disaster in Gaza that is only underscoring how much Israel needs a legitimate Palestinian partner to help govern Gaza in the morning after. The second war, very much related to the first, is the struggle within the Palestinian and Israeli societies over their respective longer-term visions. Hamas argues that this is an ethnic-religious war between primarily Muslim Palestinians and Jews, and its goal is an Islamic state in all of Palestine, from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea. For Hamas, it’s winner take all. There is a mirror image of Hamas’s extremist views on the Israeli side. The Jewish supremacist settlers represented in Netanyahu’s cabinet make no distinction between those Palestinians who have embraced Oslo and those who embrace Hamas. They see all Palestinians as modern-day descendants of the Amalekites. As Mosaic magazine explained, Amalekites were a tribe of desert raiders mentioned often in the Bible who inhabited today’s northern Negev, near the Gaza Strip, and lived by plunder. Perhaps it is not surprising, then, that some Jewish settlers simply cannot stop talking about rebuilding settlements in Gaza. They want a Greater Israel from the river to the sea. Netanyahu embraced these far-right parties and their agenda to form his government and now cannot banish them without losing his grip on power. In each community, though, you also have those who see this war as a chapter in a political struggle between two nation-states, each with a diverse citizenry that believes in theory that the war does not have to be winner take all. They envision a partitioning of the land into a Palestinian state with Muslims and Christians — and even Jews — in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, which coexists peacefully alongside an Israeli state with its own mix of Jews, Arabs and Druze. These two-staters right now are on the defensive in both communities in their struggle with the one-staters. Therefore, it is in the highest interest of the United States and all moderates to bring back the two-state alternative. That will require a reinvigorated Palestinian Authority that is cleansed of corruption and antisemitic incitement in its schoolbooks and that has reliable governing and security forces. This is where states like the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, together with the United States, should get involved immediately. Any two-state solution down the road is impossible without a credible, legitimate Palestinian Authority that Israel trusts to govern a post-Hamas Gaza and a West Bank. But that requires not only Israeli assent; it also requires Palestinians to get their act together. Are they up to it? Victory in the third war is also impossible without that. That third war is the one that scares me the most. It’s the war between Iran and its proxies — Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and Shiite militias in Iraq — against America, Israel and the moderate Arab states of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the U.A.E. and Bahrain. This war is not only about hegemony, raw power and energy sources but also about values. Israel, at its best, and America, at its best, represent the promotion of Western humanistic concepts of women’s empowerment, multiethnic democracy, pluralism, religious tolerance and the rule of law — which are a direct threat to Iran’s misogynist Islamic theocracy, which demonstrates daily its ruthless willingness to jail or even kill Iranian women for not sufficiently covering their hair. And while Arab allies of America and Israel are not democracies — and do not aspire to be — their leaders are all on a journey away from the old model of building legitimacy through resistance — resistance to Israel, to America, to Iran and Iranian-backed Shiites — and toward building their legitimacy on delivering resilience for all their people (through education, skills and growing environmental awareness) so they may realize their full potential.

Consider the research of the Israeli economist Dan Ben-David, who heads the Shoresh Institution for Socioeconomic Research at Tel Aviv University. In a country of nine million people where 21 percent of Israeli first graders are ultra-Orthodox Jews, a vast majority of whom grow up with virtually no secular education, and an additional 23 percent are Israeli Arabs, who attend chronically poorly funded and poorly staffed public schools, Ben-David noted, “fewer than 400,000 individuals are responsible for keeping Israel in the developed world.” We’re talking about the top Israeli researchers, scientists, techies, cyberspecialists and innovators who drive the start-up nation’s economy and defense industries. Today, a vast majority are highly motivated and support the Israeli government. But if Israel cannot maintain stable borders or shipping lanes, some of these 400,000 will emigrate. “If a critical mass of them decide to leave, the consequences for Israel will be catastrophic,” Ben-David said. After all, “in 2017, 92 percent of all income tax revenue came from just 20 percent of adults” — with those 400,000 responsible for creating the wealth engines that generated that 92 percent. If Iran gets away with this, its appetite for squeezing any rival with its landcraft carriers will only grow. Israel can put up a strong fight and is capable of striking deep in Iran. But ultimately, to break Iran’s tightening stranglehold, Israel needs allies from the United States and NATO and the moderate Arab states. And the United States, NATO and the moderate Arab states need Israel. But such an alliance will not come together if Netanyahu sticks with his policy of undermining the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank — essentially driving Israel and its seven million Jews into indefinite control of five million Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. The pro-American forces in the region and Biden cannot and will not be party to that. So I end where I began, only now I hope three things are totally clear. 1. The keystone for winning all three wars is a moderate, effective and legitimate Palestinian Authority that can replace Hamas in Gaza and be an active, credible partner for a two-state solution with Israel and thereby enable Saudi Arabia and other Arab Muslim states to justify normalizing relations with the Jewish state and isolating Iran and its proxies. 2. The anti-keystones are Hamas and Netanyahu’s far-right coalition, which refuses to do anything to rebuild, let alone expand, the Palestinian Authority’s role. 3. Israel and its U.S. backer cannot create a sustainable post-Hamas regional alliance or permanently stabilize Gaza while Netanyahu reigns as the prime minister of Israel.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,8,1919,0.312,0.367,0.078,0.441,0.139,0.27,0.263,0.255,0.195,0.5,0.5
178,45252,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,The Rescuers,"I confess that as a longtime observer of the Arab-Israeli conflict, I aggressively avoid both the “From the river to the sea” activists on the pro-Palestinian left and the similarly partisan zealots on the “Greater Israel” Zionist right — not just because I find their exclusivist visions for the future abhorrent but also because the reporter in me finds them so blind to the complexities of the present. They aren’t thinking about the Jewish mother in Jerusalem who told me in one breath how she just got a gun license to protect her kids from Hamas, and in the next about how much she trusted her kids’ Palestinian Arab teacher, who rushed her children to the school bomb shelter during a recent Hamas air raid. They aren’t thinking about Alaa Amara, the Israeli Arab shop owner from Taibe, who donated 50 bicycles to Jewish kids who survived the Hamas attack on their border communities on Oct. 7, only to see his shop torched, apparently by hard-line nationalist Israeli Arab youth, a few days later, only to see a crowdfunding campaign in Hebrew and English raise more than $200,000 to help him rebuild that same shop just a few days after that. Over the last half-century, I have seen Palestinians and Israelis do terrible things to one another. But this episode that began with the barbaric Hamas attack on Israelis, including women, little kids and soldiers in communities alongside Gaza, and the Israeli retaliation against Hamas fighters embedded in Gaza that has also killed, wounded and displaced so many thousands of Palestinian civilians — from newborns to the elderly — is surely the worst since the 1947 U.N. partition days. But those on all sides who read this column know that I am not one for keeping score. My focus is always on how to get out of this eye-for-an-eye, tooth-for-a-tooth horror show before everyone is left blind and toothless. To that end, I devoted a lot of time on my trip to Israel and the West Bank this month observing and probing the actual day-to-day interactions among Israeli Arabs and Jews. These are always complex, sometimes surprising, occasionally depressing — and, more often than you might expect, uplifting — experiences. Because they reveal enough seeds of coexistence scattered around that one can still dream the impossible dream — that we might one day have a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians living between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River. So, this Thanksgiving week, I ask you to spare a few moments with me to reflect on some of these people, including some of the extraordinary acts of rescue that they committed on Oct. 7. They will give you more faith in humanity than the headlines around this story would ever suggest. To put it another way, a friend once described my worldview as a cross between Thomas Hobbes and Walter Mondale. For several days on my trip, I let out my inner Mondale to chase some rays of hope shooting through the darkness. It began soon after I arrived in Tel Aviv, when I sat down with perhaps the most courageous Israeli political leader today, Mansour Abbas. Abbas is a Palestinian Arab citizen of Israel who happens to be a devout Muslim and a member of Israel’s parliament, where he leads the important United Arab List party. Abbas’s voice is even more vital now because he did not respond to the Hamas terrorism with silence. Abbas understands that while it’s right to be outraged at the pain Israel is inflicting on Gaza’s civilians, reserving all of your outrage for Gaza’s pain creates suspicion among Jews in Israel and worldwide, who notice when not a word is uttered about the Hamas atrocities that triggered this war. The first thing Abbas said to me about the Hamas onslaught was this: “No one can accept what happened on that day. And we cannot condemn it and say ‘but’ — that word ‘but’ has become immoral.” (Recent polls show overwhelming Israeli Arab condemnation of the Hamas attack.) Abbas sees the complexities lived by that Israeli Jewish mother in Jerusalem who never lost trust in her kids’ Palestinian Arab teacher, and by that Israeli Arab bicycle shop owner who spontaneously reached out a hand to ease the pain of Jewish children he’d never met. At the same time, though, Abbas spoke about the searing pain Israeli Palestinian Arabs and Bedouins feel at seeing their relatives pummeled and killed in Gaza. “One of the hardest things today is to be an Israeli Arab,” Abbas said to me. “The Arab Israeli feels the pain twice — once as an Arab and once as an Israeli.” That’s the thing about this neighborhood: If you only look at one group or the other under a microscope, you want to cry — the brutal massacre of Jews, the harsh treatment of Palestinians by Jewish supremacist settlers. The list is endless. But if you look at their stories through a kaleidoscope, observing the complexity of their interactions, you can see hope. If you want to report accurately about Israelis and Palestinians, always bring a kaleidoscope. Which brings me to the stories of the Israeli Bedouin Arabs and Oct. 7. About a week into my trip, I got a call from my friend Avrum Burg, the former speaker of the Israeli Knesset, whose grandfather was the chief rabbi of Hebron in 1929. He told me that he and his pal Talab el-Sana — an Israeli Bedouin Arab who served with him in the Knesset, and who provided a key vote that gave Yitzhak Rabin the majority that enabled him to make the Oslo peace deal — wanted to take me to meet some “righteous Bedouins.” These were Arabic-speaking but Hebrew-fluent Muslim-Bedouin citizens of Israel, who had played heroic roles in saving Jews from Hamas’s attack. Bedouins in Israel are a nomadic community who largely reside in Israel’s Negev Desert and are part of the Israeli Arab minority — 21 percent of the country — spread across cities and towns. There are some 320,000 Bedouins in Israel, with about 200,000 living in government-recognized communities and about 120,000 in makeshift, unrecognized shantytowns. Many Bedouins have served in the Israeli Army, often as trackers, because of their deep knowledge of the area’s geography from generations of roaming desert terrain. Well, it turns out that some Israeli Bedouins who lived near or worked in the border communities ravaged by Hamas helped to rescue Israeli Jews there. Some Bedouins got abducted by Hamas along with Jews, while others were murdered by Hamas because the terrorist group treated anyone who lived or worked in Israeli kibbutzim and spoke Hebrew as “Jews” — deserving to be killed. And after Oct. 7, some of those Bedouins who saved Israeli Jews found themselves being treated to hostile glances and quiet slurs by other Israeli Jews, who automatically assumed they were Hamas sympathizers. And all along, both Jewish and Bedouin victims of Hamas were treated together in Israeli hospitals, where nearly half of all the new incoming doctors are now Israeli Arabs or Druze, as are some 24 percent of the nurses and roughly 50 percent of the pharmacists. Yup, an Israeli Bedouin Arab can save an Israeli Jew on the Gaza border in the morning, be discriminated against by Jews on the streets of Beersheba in the afternoon and boast that his daughter — a doctor, trained at an Israeli medical school — stayed on her feet all night taking care of Jewish and Arab patients at Hadassah Hospital. It’s complicated. El-Sana and Burg took me to two Bedouin villages to meet young men who saved Jews. Joining us was Ran Wolf, an Israeli urban planner who specializes in building shared spaces — innovation centers, cultural centers and markets — to be used by both Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs. We stopped at Ran’s home in Tel Aviv on the way to get some water, where he told me this story: After the Hamas rockets started falling on Tel Aviv on Oct. 7, he called his regular contractor, Emad, an Israeli Arab from Jaffa, to say that the doors on the bomb shelter in his basement couldn’t be closed. “The problem was happening in a lot of shelters, and after Oct. 7 everyone wanted to get theirs fixed,” said Wolf. Indeed, when his neighbors got wind that a repairman was on the block, they asked him to fix theirs, too. “Emad is a good friend, and he refused to take any money for two days of work,” said Wolf. Keep in mind, he added, that Emad lives in Jaffa, south of Tel Aviv. In the 1948 war, Emad’s father stayed in Jaffa and his uncle fled to Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. “So he was raised in Israel — but half his family is now in Gaza,” Wolf said. “He himself got a Hamas missile 200 yards from his home in Jaffa” the other day, he added. Get out your kaleidoscope: Today you have Jaffa Palestinian refugees living under a Hamas government in Gaza who are firing rockets at Jaffa Palestinians who are Israeli citizens, one of whom repaired the rocket shelters of his Jewish friends in Tel Aviv — for free. When we arrived in Rahat, the largest Bedouin town in Israel in the Negev Desert, el-Sana, sitting in the back seat of the car, managed to one-up that story. He explained that some of the first Israeli victims of the Hamas rocket attacks on Oct. 7 were actually Bedouins, many of whom live in unrecognized villages in the Negev that are not listed on any digital maps. (The Israeli government has not kept up with their population growth, as it has for most Jewish towns.) Those villages do not have municipal bomb shelters or warning sirens to protect their people when Hamas rockets start landing, but — and you cannot make this up — el-Sana explained that the way Israel’s Iron Dome antimissile system works is that when Hamas launches a rocket it automatically plots the trajectory to determine if that rocket from Gaza will land on a settled space in Israel, and kill people, or on an empty field or in the sea. If it is an empty space on a map or in the sea, Iron Dome won’t waste one of its expensive rockets shooting down a cheap Hamas rocket. Six Bedouins were killed by a Hamas rocket that landed on their village of Al Bat — including two brothers, ages 11 and 12 — because that Bedouin town is not on any official Israeli map loaded into the Iron Dome database, el-Sana explained. Meanwhile, eight other Bedouins who worked in Jewish communities near Gaza were murdered by Hamas and at least seven more Bedouins, all Israeli citizens, are believed to have been kidnapped and taken to Gaza. And yet days later some of these same Bedouins did not hesitate to help rescue Israeli Jews, along with their cousins. El-Sana had set up an interview for me in Al Zayada village, an unrecognized Bedouin settlement in the Negev, at the unrecognized home of Youssef Ziadna, 47, a Bedouin driver who had been recognized for rescuing Jews on Oct. 7. Ziadna, a bus driver, explained that on Friday, Oct. 6, he was hired to drive a group of Jewish kids to an outdoor trance music festival called the Supernova Sukkot Gathering, celebrating the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, adjacent to Kibbutz Re’im, which is adjacent to the Gaza border. “After I dropped them off, we agreed that on Saturday I would come back and take them home at 6 p.m.,” he told me. But early on Saturday morning, “I got a call from one of them, Amit,” telling him to come immediately, he said. “They were being attacked and there was gunfire everywhere.” As he rushed to the scene and got near the kibbutz, Ziadna said, “I saw a barrage of rockets and many cars coming toward me — escaping — blinking their lights for me to turn around. Some people who stopped and jumped out of their cars said there were terrorists in Be’eri, so ‘run away.’ I got out of my car and hid on the side of the road and every time I raised my head I got shot at. But I committed to pick these people up, and it was a kilometer away.” Ziadna said that when the shooting subsided for a bit, he managed to get back in his vehicle and use his cellphone to link up with Amit and his friends — and anyone else he could cram into his minibus. Instead of driving back on the road, where “I knew they’d kill us,” he said, “I drove through the fields.” As a Bedouin, Ziadna had intimate knowledge of the terrain that proved lifesaving. He was able to cut a route through fields and avoid the main thoroughfare near where Hamas terrorists were ambushing escapees from the music festival. Many other escaping cars then also jumped off the road and followed Ziadna’s minibus through the fields, he said. He told The Times of Israel, which profiled him, that he crammed some 30 people into his vehicle, even though it was licensed for only 14 passengers. A few days later, he said he got a call from a phone number he did not recognize but that he believed was from Gaza, and a voice said in Arabic: “Are you Youssef Ziadna? You saved the lives of Jews? We’re going to kill you.” He reported the call to the Israeli police. It’s just one reason, he said, that he still needs daily phone calls with a psychologist to try to overcome his trauma from Oct. 7. Another family member at our gathering, Daham Ziadna, 35, said a total of four of their family members were abducted by Hamas; one was killed for sure, and three others are still missing. Two of them were last seen lying on the ground in a TikTok video released by Hamas, with two gun-toting Hamas fighters standing over them. For Hamas, said Daham, “everyone who lives in Israel is a Jew.” Daham told me that a few days ago he had gone to the local bank to withdraw some money from the A.T.M., and two Israeli Jews passed him on the sidewalk. “One had a Russian accent. As they walked past me, the Russian guy said, ‘Here’s another Arab.’ I said to him: ‘These “Arabs” you are talking about on the morning of Oct. 7 were on the border of Gaza fighting for the Israeli state — regardless of Jews or Arabs — and the ones who destroy the country are people like you who incite poison.’” Israeli Arabs live between a rock and a hard place, he added: “Many Jews look at us as if we are all Hamas, and the Hamas people look at us as if we are all Jews.” A few miles away, in Rahat, el-Sana introduced me to the al-Qrinawi family, who had their own remarkable tale to tell. Their family spokesman, Ismail, led me through the drama, flanked by his male cousins and a giant platter of rice, chicken and chickpeas. On the morning of Oct. 7, as word spread of the Hamas attack, they discovered through their family’s WhatsApp group that three of their cousins who worked in the dining room at Kibbutz Be’eri had apparently been abducted. Around 10 a.m., one family member got a call from the phone of an Israeli woman named Aya Medan that was strange. It turned out she had met up with one of their missing cousins, Hisham, and they were hiding together from the Hamas terrorists in the same thorny bush near Be’eri. Hisham used her cellphone to call his Bedouin clan for help. Their other two cousins had fled in another direction. Their uncle, the family patriarch, ordered four of his nephews to get in the family Land Cruiser and go rescue them, since the area was normally about 30 minutes away — but not that day. They grabbed two handguns and sped off. “When we got close, we found that all the roads were closed,” Ismail told me. “So we went through the woods and through a deep wadi in order to go around. Our car almost flipped over in the wadi.” First, “we bumped into people running away from the party,” he said. “We gave them our phones to call their parents and made sure that they got into other cars that were driven by Israelis. We managed to rescue 30 or 40 people at the party. But all the time, I am talking to Aya, trying to locate her and Hisham.” It was taking forever. After two and a half hours of dodging gunfire and Hamas rockets, Ismail said, they managed to find Aya and Hisham hiding in bushes very close to Kibbutz Be’eri. The two had sent a cellphone picture of the area where they were hiding so they could be more easily located. Minutes later, Aya recalled for The Times of Israel, Hisham tugged at her, saying, “Aya, they’re here, they’re actually here.” The cousins opened the car doors, Aya and Hisham scrambled inside and the Bedouins again used their off-road skills to get them to safety. Sort of...In our interview, Abbas told me that we need “a new political rhetoric” and not to get drawn back into the old games. “This ‘river to the sea’ talk is not helpful,” he said. “They are making a mistake. If you want to help Palestinians, then talk about a two-state solution and peace and security for all the people.” That is why, he added, “I am working on a plan that starts by ending the current war and ends with the creation of a Palestinian state alongside of Israel.” Abbas is cleareyed about the difficult road ahead. I am, too. I finished my recent journey with two takeaways. The first is that this Gaza war is still far from over. Israel believes there will be no peace in or from Gaza as long as Hamas is in power there. But the other is that just as the darkness of the Yom Kippur War produced the dawn of the Camp David treaty, and just as the viciousness of the first intifada and the Israeli pushback led to the Oslo Accords, out of the horrors of Oct. 7 will one day come another attempt to build two states for these two indigenous peoples. Otherwise, this whole corner of the world will become uninhabitable for any sane person. There are just too many people with too many powerful weapons today. And when that day comes, it will take a bridge-builder like Mansour Abbas — who understands the true kaleidoscopic reality of this place, and the authentic connection of both communities to it — to nurture the seeds of coexistence that are still here, albeit buried deeper than ever. Abbas, Youssef Ziadna, the al-Qrinawi family, Aya Medan, my friends Avrum, Talab and Ran — they will be the rescuers.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2,3186,0.53,0.213,0.271,0.5,0.5,0.292,0.379,0.317,0.106,0.5,0.5
179,45244,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,The Most Revealing Moment From My Trip to Israel,"During my nine days of reporting recently in Israel and the West Bank, little did I know that the most revealing moment would come in the final hours of my visit. As I was packing to leave on Saturday night, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave a news conference in which he indicated that Israel and the United States do not have a shared vision of how Israel should complete its war in Gaza or how to convert any Israeli victory over Hamas into a lasting peace with the Palestinians. Without such a shared strategy, the Biden administration and the American people, particularly American Jews who support Israel, will need to make some fateful decisions. We will have to either become captives of Netanyahu’s strategy — which could take us all down with him — or articulate an American vision for how the Gaza war must end. That would require a Biden administration plan to create two states for two indigenous peoples living in the areas of Gaza, the West Bank and Israel. Yes, I am talking about a wartime peace plan that, if Israel agreed, could help give Israel the time, legitimacy, allies and resources it needs to defeat Hamas — without getting stuck governing all of Gaza and all of the West Bank forever, with no political horizon for the Palestinians. And have no illusion, Netanyahu is offering only one vision right now: Seven million Jews trying to govern five million Palestinians in perpetuity — and that is a prescription for disaster for Israel, America, Jews everywhere and America’s moderate Arab allies. The Biden plan — are you sitting down? — could actually use as one of its starting points President Donald Trump’s proposal for a two-state solution, because Netanyahu embraced that in 2020, when he had a different coalition. (Netanyahu and his ambassador in Washington practically wrote the Trump plan.) More on that in a second. Here is why we are at a juncture that demands bold ideas, starting this past Saturday night. Speaking in Hebrew in a news conference with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Minister Benny Gantz, Netanyahu rejected U.S. and world concerns over the thousands of Palestinian lives already lost to the war to uproot Hamas from Gaza. Even more important, he declared that Israel’s military would remain in Gaza “as long as necessary” to prevent the Gaza Strip from ever again being used to launch attacks on Israeli civilians. Gaza “will be demilitarized,” he said. “There will be no further threat from the Gaza Strip on Israel, and to ensure that, for as long as necessary, I.D.F. will control Gaza security to prevent terrorism from there,” he added, referring to the Israel Defense Forces. Those are legitimate Israeli concerns, given the Hamas atrocities of Oct. 7, but Netanyahu also indicated that Israel would oppose the return of the Palestinian Authority — Israel’s partner in the Oslo peace process that governs Palestinians in the West Bank — to Gaza after the war. The authority, Netanyahu said, is “a civil authority that educates its children to hate Israel, to kill Israelis, to eliminate the State of Israel … an authority that pays the families of murderers based on the number they murdered … an authority whose leader still has not condemned the terrible massacre 30 days later.” Bibi — who never gives the Palestinian Authority credit for how it works every day with Israeli security officials to dampen violence in the West Bank — offered no suggestion of how and from where an alternative, legitimate Palestinian governing authority ready to work with Israel might emerge. This was an in-your-face rebuke of the Biden administration position articulated by Secretary of State Antony Blinken last Wednesday. As The Times reported, Blinken declared during a meeting of foreign ministers in Tokyo that Gaza should be unified with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority once the war is over. To retain America’s Arab and Western allies, Blinken said that right now — today — we must articulate “affirmative elements to get to a sustained peace.” And “these must include the Palestinian people’s voices and aspirations at the center of postcrisis governance in Gaza,” he said. “It must include Palestinian-led governance and Gaza unified with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority.” My four-word translation of Blinken’s proposal to Israel: “Help us help you.” Blinken, though, also offered no details of how that might happen. The Biden team needs to flesh that out. Why is Netanyahu trying to destroy the Palestinian Authority as a governing option for a postwar Gaza? Because he is already campaigning to hold on to power after the Gaza war is over, and he knows there will be a huge surge of Israelis demanding he step down because of how he and his far-right cronies distracted and divided Israel and its military by pursuing a judicial coup that Israeli intelligence sources told Netanyahu was emboldening and tempting enemies such as Hamas and Hezbollah. The only way Netanyahu can stay in power is if his far-right allies don’t abandon him, particularly Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. So to hold the support of the Jewish supremacists in his cabinet — some of whom want Israel to erect settlements in Gaza as soon as possible — Netanyahu has to declare now that the Palestinians will have no legitimate, independent representation in Gaza or the West Bank. Yes, I know it is hard to believe, but Netanyahu is campaigning in the middle of this war. It is time for President Biden to create a moment of truth for everyone — for Netanyahu, for the Palestinians and their supporters, for Israel and its supporters and for AIPAC, the pro-Israel lobby. Biden needs to make clear that America will not be Netanyahu’s useful idiot. We are going to lay down the principles of a fair peace plan for the morning after this war — one that reflects our interests and that will also enable us to support Israel and moderate Palestinians and win the support of moderate Arabs for an economic reconstruction of Gaza after the war. I cannot see any major economic support for the rebuilding of Gaza coming from Europe or from countries like the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia unless Israel and some legitimate Palestinian authority are committed to the principles of a peace framework to create two states for two peoples. Biden needs to say: “Israel, we are covering your flank militarily with our two aircraft carriers, financially with $14 billion in aid and diplomatically at the U.N. The price for that is your acceptance of a peace framework based on two states for two indigenous peoples in Gaza, the West Bank and pre-1967 Israel.” This plan is based on U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338, which was also the cornerstone for negotiations in the peace plan put forward by Trump in 2020. “Bibi, do you remember what you said about that Trump plan that gave Palestinians about 70 percent of the West Bank for a state, plus an expanded Gaza Strip and a capital in the area of Jerusalem?” Biden could add. “Here’s the Associated Press story of Jan. 28, 2020, to remind you: ‘Netanyahu called it a “historic breakthrough” equal in significance to the country’s declaration of independence in 1948.’” The Palestinian Authority foolishly rejected the Trump plan outright instead of asking to use it as a starting point. This is a chance to make up for that mistake — or be exposed as unserious. In his valuable new book on the history of the peace process, “(In)Sights: Peacemaking in the Oslo Process Thirty Years and Counting,” Gidi Grinstein, a member of Ehud Barak’s negotiating team at Camp David, argues that the Trump plan provides a natural foundation for a revived peace process for a two-state solution. That is not only because Netanyahu already agreed to it, Grinstein told me in an interview, even if the settler hard-liners in his cabinet did not and still would not. It’s also viable because the Trump plan was actually based on the condition that peace was possible only after Hamas was removed from power in Gaza and the Palestinian Authority could assume control of the Gaza Strip, which, the Trump plan argued, would be expanded by land carved from Israel’s Negev Desert. Biden could also propose that with the help of our moderate Arab allies, such as the U.A.E., Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Bahrain, we would come up with a plan to overhaul the Palestinian Authority, purge its education system of anti-Israel material, upgrade its forces that work daily with Israeli security teams in the West Bank and phase out its financial support for Palestinian prisoners who harmed Israelis. Is the Palestinian Authority up to such a deal? Are progressive Palestinian supporters in the West who chant the eliminationist mantra “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” up for it? Will Israel’s silent majority be if Hamas is defeated? Let’s see what they all really stand for — or if they have a better answer — because neither is going to disappear. Biden needs to put them all to the test. I know that a lot of American Jewish leaders privately would love Biden to put forward such a plan, but so far only one, Ronald Lauder, a longtime Republican and the president of the World Jewish Congress, has had the courage to call for it — in a Saudi newspaper, no less, in an essay titled, “A Time for Peace and a Two-State Solution.” As he explained, “Only a two-state solution would guarantee Israelis and Palestinians a life in dignity, safety and with a better perspective on the economic situation, which would lead to a sustainable future.” Such a plan would protect America’s interests and make clear that we care about what’s best for Israelis and Palestinians and our allies in the region, not what’s best for Bibi’s political future — which several Israeli analysts told me would be to drag out the war, so he couldn’t be ousted by mass demonstrations, or to drag us into a conflict with Iran in hopes that it would overshadow all his mistakes. If a two-state plan was embraced by Israel, even with reservations, it would reinforce for the world that Israel sees its war in Gaza as one of necessary self-defense and a prelude to lasting peace. And if such a plan was embraced by the Palestinian Authority, even with reservations, that would reinforce that the authority intends to be the alternative to Hamas in shaping an independent future for Palestinians alongside Israel — and that it will not be a bystander to Hamas’s madness or a victim of it.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9,1789,0.948,0.433,0.592,0.223,0.152,0.363,0.43,0.241,0.345,0.5,0.574
180,45252,Bernie Sanders,The New York Times,Bernie Sanders: Justice for the Palestinians and Security for Israel,"There have been five wars in the last 15 years between Israel and Hamas. How do we end the current one and prevent a sixth from happening, sooner or later? How do we balance our desire to stop the fighting with the need to address the roots of the conflict? For 75 years, diplomats, well-intentioned Israelis and Palestinians and government leaders around the world have struggled to bring peace to this region. In that time an Egyptian president and an Israeli prime minister were assassinated by extremists for their efforts to end the violence. And on and on it goes. For those of us who want not only to bring this war to an end, but to avoid a future one, we must first be cleareyed about facts. On Oct. 7, Hamas, a terrorist organization, unleashed a barbaric attack against Israel, killing about 1,200 innocent men, women and children and taking more than 200 hostage. On a per-capita basis, if Israel had the same population as the United States, that attack would have been the equivalent of nearly 40,000 deaths, more than 10 times the fatalities that we suffered on 9/11. Israel, in response, under the leadership of its right-wing prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who is under indictment for corruption and whose cabinet includes outright racists, unleashed what amounts to total war against the Palestinian people. In Gaza, over 1.6 million Palestinians were forced out of their homes. Food, water, medical supplies and fuel were cut off. The United Nations estimates that 45 percent of the housing units in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed. According to the Gaza health ministry, more than 12,000 Palestinians, about half of whom are children, have been killed and many more wounded. And the situation becomes more dire every day. This is a humanitarian catastrophe that risks igniting a wider regional conflagration. We all want it to end as soon as possible. To make progress, however, we must grapple with the complexity of this situation that too many people on both sides want to wave away. First, Hamas has made it clear, before and after Oct. 7, that its goal is perpetual warfare and the destruction of the state of Israel. Just last week a spokesman for Hamas told The New York Times: “I hope that the state of war with Israel will become permanent on all the borders, and that the Arab world will stand with us.” Second, Israel has done nothing in recent years to give hope for a peaceful settlement — maintaining the blockade of Gaza, deepening the daily humiliations of occupation in the West Bank, and largely ignoring the horrendous living conditions facing Palestinians. Needless to say, I do not have all of the answers to this never-ending tragedy. But for those of us who believe in peace and justice, it is imperative that we do our best to provide Israelis and Palestinians with a thoughtful response that maps out a realistic path to addressing the reality we face today. Here are my thoughts as to the best way forward and how the United States can rally the world around a moral position that moves us toward peace in the region and justice for the oppressed Palestinian population. To start, we must demand an immediate end to Israel’s indiscriminate bombing, which is causing an enormous number of civilian casualties and is in violation of international law. Israel is at war with Hamas, not innocent Palestinian men, women and children. Israel cannot bomb an entire neighborhood to take out one Hamas target. We don’t know if this campaign has been effective in degrading Hamas’s military capabilities. But we do know that a reported 70 percent of the casualties are women and children, and that 104 U.N. aid workers and 53 journalists have been killed. That’s not acceptable. There must also be a significant, extended humanitarian pause so that badly needed aid — food, water, medicine and fuel — can get into Gaza and save lives. If Wednesday morning’s deal — in which 50 Israeli hostages are to be freed in exchange for a four-day pause in fighting — is honored, it is a promising first step that we can build upon, and hopefully work to extend the pause. Meanwhile, the United Nations must be given time to safely set up the distribution network needed to prevent thirst, starvation and disease, to build shelters and evacuate those who need critical care. This window will also allow for talks to free as many hostages as possible. This extended pause must not precede a resumption of indiscriminate bombing. Israel will continue to go after Hamas, but it must dramatically change its tactics to minimize civilian harm.

If long-suffering Palestinians are ever going to have a chance at self-determination and a decent standard of living, there must be no long-term Israeli re-occupation and blockade of Gaza. If Hamas is going to be removed from power, as it must be, and Palestinians given the opportunity for a better life, an Israeli occupation of Gaza would be absolutely counterproductive and would benefit Hamas. For the sake of regional peace and a brighter future for the Palestinian people, Gaza must have a chance to be free of Hamas. There can be no long-term Israeli occupation.

To achieve the political transformation that Gaza needs, new Palestinian leadership will be required as part of a wider political process. And for that transformation and peace process to take place, Israel must make certain political commitments that will allow for Palestinian leadership committed to peace to build support. They must guarantee displaced Palestinians the absolute right to return to their homes as Gaza rebuilds. People who have lived in poverty and despair for years cannot be made permanently homeless. Israel must also commit to end the killings of Palestinians in the West Bank and freeze settlements there as a first step toward permanently ending the occupation. Those steps will show that peace can deliver for the Palestinian people, hopefully giving the Palestinian Authority the legitimacy it needs to assume administrative control of Gaza, likely after an interim stabilization period under an international force. Finally, if Palestinians are to have any hope for a decent future, there must be a commitment to broad peace talks to advance a two-state solution in the wake of this war. The United States, the international community and Israel’s neighbors must move aggressively toward that goal. This would include dramatically increased international support for the Palestinian people, including from wealthy Gulf States. It would also mean the promise of full recognition of Palestine pending the formation of a new democratically elected government committed to peace with Israel. Let’s be clear: this is not going to happen on its own. Mr. Netanyahu’s Likud party was explicitly formed on the premise that “between the Sea and the Jordan [River] there will only be Israeli sovereignty,” and the current coalition agreement reinforces that goal. This is not just ideology. The Israeli government has systematically pursued this goal. The last year saw record Israeli settlement growth in the West Bank, where more than 700,000 Israelis now live in areas that the United Nations and the United States agree are occupied territories. They have used state violence to back up this de facto annexation. Since Oct. 7, the United Nations reports that at least 208 Palestinians, including 53 children, have been killed by Israeli security forces and settlers. This cannot be allowed to continue. Mr. Netanyahu has made clear where he stands on these critical issues. So should we. If asking nicely worked, we wouldn’t be in this position. The only way these necessary changes will happen is if the United States uses the substantial leverage we have with Israel. And we all know what that leverage is. For many years, the United States has provided Israel substantial sums of money — with close to no strings attached. Currently, we provide $3.8 billion a year. President Biden has asked for $14.3 billion more on top of that sum and asked Congress to waive normal, already-limited oversight rules. The blank check approach must end. The United States must make clear that while we are friends of Israel, there are conditions to that friendship and that we cannot be complicit in actions that violate international law and our own sense of decency. That includes an end to indiscriminate bombing; a significant pause to bombing so that massive humanitarian assistance can come into the region; the right of displaced Gazans to return to their homes; no long-term Israeli occupation of Gaza; an end to settler violence in the West Bank and a freeze on settlement expansion; and a commitment to broad peace talks for a two-state solution in the wake of the war. Over the years, people of good will around the world, including Israelis, have tried to address this conflict in a way that brings justice for Palestinians and security for Israel. I, and some other members of Congress, have tried to do what we could. Obviously, we did not do enough. Now we must recommit to this effort. The stakes are just too high to give up.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10,1523,0.738,0.1,0.264,0.159,0.5,0.093,0.134,0.324,0.099,0.5,0.5
181,45248,Hiba Yazbek,The New York Times,"Hospitals in southern Gaza are becoming overwhelmed, doctors say.","The influx of people wounded in airstrikes and those displaced from the north — many already suffering from injury and illness — is putting increasing pressure on hospitals in southern Gaza, a doctor said. People who evacuated hospitals in the north and arrived at the European Gaza Hospital in Khan Younis, in the south, have been met with familiar scenes: Families were sleeping in overcrowded corridors while staff members scrambled to treat people amid a shortage of beds that left some patients on the floor, Dr. Saleh Al-Hamase, the head of nursing at the hospital, said in a phone interview. He added that the hospital had received thousands of displaced people seeking shelter and dozens of patients who fled the north over the last two weeks as Israel has pushed further into Gaza. “We are days away from running out of fuel and collapsing,” said Dr. Al-Hamase. “The scenes at the hospital are tragic, and the bombardment around us is continuous.” The hospital was operating well over its capacity, Dr. Al-Hamase said, and staff members had to reuse disposable medical supplies and ration the remaining fuel by generating power for only essential services. The hospital’s water supply had mostly run out, he said, “due to the pressure on our supply from the huge number of displaced people staying here.” Dozens of wounded people arrived at the hospital last week from Al-Shifa Hospital in the north after a nearly 16-mile journey, many on foot and some in wheelchairs, said Dr. Al-Hamase, while only the most severe cases were brought in ambulances. The hospital was preparing on Saturday to receive another 200 patients arriving from Al-Shifa, Dr. Al-Hamase said in a WhatsApp message. Israeli troops had gradually encircled, then raided the Al-Shifa complex on Wednesday in search of a Hamas command center. On Saturday, patients, medical workers and displaced people began leaving Al-Shifa, witnesses said. Some headed south toward Khan Younis. The general director of Gaza’s hospitals, Dr. Muhammad Zaqout, warned on Tuesday that hospitals in the southern enclave had “begun to go out of service due to the running out of fuel.” The main generator at Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis stopped working on Monday because of a lack of fuel, according to a statement by the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, leaving medical staff, 90 patients and around 9,000 displaced people sheltering there to rely on a “very small generator to supply electricity only to the maternity ward and emergency lighting.” “If the displacement crisis continues,” Dr. Al-Hamase said, “the health sector in Gaza will completely collapse.”",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9,426,0.185,0.256,0.252,0.5,0.5,0.393,0.299,0.121,0.237,0.5,0.5

Israel said the vessel was not an Israeli ship. Yemen’s Houthi militia hijacked a ship in the Red Sea on Sunday, in what the Iran-backed group said was a demonstration of support for “the oppressed Palestinian people.” Only hours earlier, the group threatened to target Israeli-flagged, -owned and -operated ships traversing the Red Sea. The Israeli military called the episode on Sunday a “grave event,” saying that the ship was en route to India from Turkey and had an “international crew, without Israelis.” “This is not an Israeli ship,” the military said in a statement. The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said in a statement that the vessel was British-owned and operated by a Japanese company. It had 25 crew members on board, the statement said, condemning the attack without naming the vessel. The Houthis, however, said they had hijacked an “Israeli ship” and taken it to the Yemeni coast. They said they would deal with its crew members “in accordance with the teachings and values of our Islamic religion.” News reports identified the ship as the Galaxy Leader, which bore no obvious links to Israel. The ship sailed under the flag of the Bahamas — a popular place for ship registration because of tax advantages — and is listed as a vehicle carrier owned by an Isle of Man-based firm called Ray Car Carriers Ltd., according to Marine Traffic, a real-time maritime data platform. The company’s beneficial owner appears to have at some point been the Israeli billionaire Rami Ungar, according to the Paradise Papers, a major leak of confidential documents that in 2017 exposed a hidden world of wealth and ownerships.

Hamas said she had been killed by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza on Thursday. The Israeli military confirmed the death of the soldier, Noa Marciano, in a brief statement on Tuesday that did not indicate how she had died but said she had been “kidnapped by a terrorist organization.” An earlier statement that appeared to confirm the authenticity of the video condemned it as “psychological terrorism.” Ms. Marciano served in an intelligence unit and was stationed at a lookout post on Kibbutz Nahal Oz when Hamas attacked.    “Our hearts are with the Marciano family,” Israeli military officials said in a statement, noting that a military representative had visited the family and informed them of the video’s release. Military officials pledged to support the Marcianos and other hostages’ families, promising that they are “using all means, both intelligence and operational, to bring the hostages home.” The video shows Ms. Marciano speaking into a camera and providing identifying information about herself and her family. She says that she is being held in Gaza and has been there for about four days with other hostages, and she pleads with the Israeli military to stop targeting the area, saying the explosions are close by, continual and could harm the hostages.

184,45239,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,I Have Never Been to This Israel Before,"People warned me before I came to Tel Aviv a few days ago that the Israel of Oct. 7 is an Israel that I’ve never been to before. They were right. It is a place in which Israelis have never lived before, a nation that Israeli generals have never had to protect before, an ally that America has never had to defend before — certainly not with the urgency and resolve that would lead a U.S. president to fly over and buck up the whole nation. After traveling around Israel and the West Bank, I now understand why so much has changed. It is crystal clear to me that Israel is in real danger — more danger than at any other time since its War of Independence in 1948. And it’s for three key reasons: First, Israel is facing threats from a set of enemies who combine medieval theocratic worldviews with 21st-century weaponry — and are no longer organized as small bands of militiamen but as modern armies with brigades, battalions, cybercapabilities, long-range rockets, drones and technical support. I am speaking about Iranian-backed Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic militias in Iraq and the Houthis in Yemen — and now even the openly Hamas-embracing Vladimir Putin. These foes have long been there, but all of them seemed to surface together like dragons during this conflict, threatening Israel with a 360-degree war all at once. How does a modern democracy live with such a threat? This is exactly the question these demonic forces wanted to instill in the mind of every Israeli. They are not seeking a territorial compromise with the Jewish state. Their goal is to collapse the confidence of Israelis that their defense and intelligence services can protect them from surprise attacks across their borders — so Israelis will, first, move away from the border regions and then they will move out of the country altogether. I am stunned by how many Israelis now feel this danger personally, no matter where they live — starting with a friend who lives in Jerusalem telling me that she and her husband just got gun licenses to have pistols at home. No one is going to snatch their children and take them into a tunnel. Hamas, alas, has tunneled fear into many, many Israeli heads far from the Gaza border. The second danger I see is that the only conceivable way that Israel can generate the legitimacy, resources, time and allies to fight such a difficult war with so many enemies is if it has unwavering partners abroad, led by the United States. President Biden, quite heroically, has been trying to help Israel with its immediate and legitimate goal of dismantling Hamas’s messianic terrorist regime in Gaza — which is as much a threat to the future of Israel as it is to Palestinians longing for a decent state of their own in Gaza or the West Bank. But Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza entails urban, house-to-house fighting that creates thousands of civilian casualties — innocent men, women and children — among whom Hamas deliberately embedded itself to force Israel to have to kill those innocents in order to kill the Hamas leadership and uproot its miles of attack tunnels. But Biden can sustainably generate the support Israel needs only if Israel is ready to engage in some kind of a wartime diplomatic initiative directed at the Palestinians in the West Bank — and hopefully in a post-Hamas Gaza — that indicates Israel will discuss some kind of two-state solutions if Palestinian officials can get their political house unified and in order. This leads directly to my third, deep concern. Israel has the worst leader in its history — maybe in all of Jewish history — who has no will or ability to produce such an initiative. Worse, I am stunned by the degree to which that leader, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, continues to put the interests of holding on to the support of his far-right base — and pre-emptively blaming Israel’s security and intelligence services for the war — ahead of maintaining national solidarity or doing some of the basic things that Biden needs in order to get Israel the resources, allies, time and legitimacy it needs to defeat Hamas. Biden cannot help Israel build a coalition of U.S., European and moderate Arab partners to defeat Hamas if Netanyahu’s message to the world remains, in effect: “Help us defeat Hamas in Gaza while we work to expand settlements, annex the West Bank and build a Jewish supremacist state there.” Let’s drill down on these dangers. Last Saturday night, a retired Israeli Army commander stopped by my hotel in Tel Aviv to share his perspective on the war. I took him to the 18th-floor executive lounge for our chat, and when we got into the elevator to go up, we joined a family of four — two parents, a toddler and a baby in a stroller. The Israeli general asked them where they were from. “Kiryat Shmona,” the father answered. As we stepped out, I joked with the general that he could dispense with his briefing. It took just 18 floors and those two words — “Kiryat Shmona” — to describe Israel’s wickedly complex new strategic dilemma created by the surprise Hamas attack of Oct. 7. Kiryat Shmona is one of the most important Israeli towns on the border with Lebanon. That father said his family had fled the northern fence line with thousands of other Israeli families after the pro-Iranian Hezbollah militia and Palestinian militias in southern Lebanon began lobbing rockets and artillery and making incursions in solidarity with Hamas. When might they go back? They had no idea. Like more than 200,000 other Israelis, they have taken refuge with friends or in hotels all across this small country of nine million people. And it has taken only a few weeks for Israelis to begin driving up real estate prices in seemingly safer central Israeli towns. For Hezbollah, that alone is mission accomplished, without even invading like Hamas. Together, Hezbollah and Hamas are managing to shrink Israel. On Sunday I drove down to a hotel on the Dead Sea to meet some of the hundreds of surviving members of Kibbutz Be’eri, which had some 1,200 residents, including 360 children. It was one of the communities hardest hit by the Hamas onslaught — suffering more than 130 murders in addition to scores of injured and multiple kidnappings of children and elderly. The Israeli government has moved most survivors of the kibbutz across the country to the Dead Sea, where they are now starting their own schools in a hotel ballroom. I asked Liat Admati, 35, a survivor of the Hamas attack who ran a clinic for facial cosmetics for 11 years in Be’eri, what would make it possible for her to go back to her Gaza border home, where she was raised. “The main thing for me to go back is to feel safe,” she said. “Before this situation, I felt I have trust in the army. Now I feel the trust is broken. I don’t want to feel that we are covering ourselves in walls and shelters all the time while behind this fence there are people who can one day do this again. I really don’t know at this point what the solution is.” Before Oct. 7, she and her neighbors thought the threat was rockets, she said, so they built safe rooms, but now that Hamas gunmen came over and burned parents and kids in their safe rooms, who knows what is safe? “The safe room was designed to keep you safe from rockets, not from another human who would come and kill you for who you are,"" she said. What is most dispiriting, she concluded, is that it appears that some Gazans who worked on the kibbutz gave Hamas maps of the layout. There are a lot of Israelis who listened to the recording, published by The Times of Israel, of a Hamas gunman who took part in the Oct. 7 onslaught, identified by his father as Mahmoud, calling his parents from the phone of a Jewish woman he’d just murdered and imploring them to check his WhatsApp messages to see the pictures he took of some of the 10 Jews he alone killed in Mefalsim, a kibbutz near the Gaza border. “Look how many I killed with my own hands! Your son killed Jews,” he says, according to an English translation. “Mom, your son is a hero,” he adds. His parents can be heard seemingly rejoicing. This kind of chilling exuberance — Israel was built so that such a thing could never happen — explains the homemade sign I saw on a sidewalk while driving through the French Hill Jewish neighborhood of Jerusalem the other day: “It’s either us or them.’’ The euphoric rampage of Oct. 7 that killed some 1,400 soldiers and civilians has not only hardened Israeli hearts toward the suffering of Gaza civilians. It has also inflicted a deep sense of humiliation and guilt on the Israeli Army and defense establishment, for having failed in their most basic mission of protecting the country’s borders. As a result, there is a conviction in the army that it must demonstrate to the entire neighborhood — to Hezbollah in Lebanon, to the Houthis in Yemen, to the Islamic militias in Iraq, to the Hamas and other fighters in the West Bank — that it will stop at nothing to re-establish the security of the borders. While the army insists that it is hewing to the laws of war, it wants to show that no one can outcrazy Israel to drive its people from this region — even if the Israeli military has to defy the U.S. and even if it does not have any solid plan for governing Gaza the morning after the war. As Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, told reporters on Wednesday: “Israel cannot accept such an active threat on its borders. The whole idea of people living side by side in the Middle East was jeopardized by Hamas.” This conflict is now back to its most biblical and primordial roots. This seems to be a time of eyes for eyes and teeth for teeth. The morning-after policy thinking will have to wait for the mourning after. Which is why I so worry about the leadership here today. I was traveling around the West Bank on Tuesday when I heard that Netanyahu had just told ABC News that Israel plans to retain “overall security responsibility” in Gaza “for an indefinite period” after its war with Hamas. Really? Consider this context: “According to Israel’s official Central Bureau of Statistics, at the end of 2021, 9.449 million people live in Israel (including Israelis in West Bank settlements), the Times of Israel reported last year. “Of those, 6.982 million (74 percent) are Jewish, 1.99 million (21 percent) are Arab, and 472,000 (5 percent) are neither. The Palestinian Bureau of Statistics puts the West Bank Palestinian population at a little over three million and the Gaza population at just over two million.” So Netanyahu is saying that seven million Jews are going to indefinitely control the lives of five million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza — while offering them no political horizon, nothing, by way of statehood one day on any demilitarized conditions. Early on the morning of Oct. 29, as the Israeli Army was just moving into Gaza, Netanyahu posted and then deleted a message on social media in which he blamed Israel’s defense and intelligence establishment for failing to anticipate Hamas’s surprise attack. (Netanyahu somehow forgot how often the Israeli military and intelligence leaders had warned him that his totally unnecessary coup against the country’s judicial system was fracturing the army and Israel’s enemies were all noticing its vulnerability.) After being slammed by the public for digitally stabbing his army and intelligence chiefs in the back in the middle of a war, Netanyahu published a new post. “I was wrong,” he wrote, adding that “the things I said following the press conference should not have been said, and I apologize for that. I fully support the heads of [Israel’s] security services.” But the damage was done. How much do you suppose those military leaders trust what Netanyahu will say if the Gaza campaign stalls? What real leader would behave that way at the start of a war of survival? Let me not mince words, because the hour is dark and Israel, as I said, is in real danger. Netanyahu and his far-right zealots have taken Israel on multiple flights of fancy in the last year: dividing the country and the army over the fraudulent judicial reform, bankrupting its future with massive investments in religious schools that teach no math and in West Bank Jewish settlements that teach no pluralism — while building up Hamas, which would never be a partner for peace, and tearing down the Palestinian Authority, the only possible partner for peace. The sooner Israel replaces Netanyahu and his far-right allies with a true center-left-center-right national unity government, the better chance it has to hold together during what is going to be a hellish war and aftermath. And the better chance that Biden — who may be down in the polls in America but could get elected here in a landslide for the empathy and steel he showed at Israel’s hour of need — will not have hitched his credibility and ours to a Netanyahu Israel that will never be able to fully help us to help it. This society is so much better than its leader. It is too bad it took a war to drive that home. Ron Scherf is a retired member of Israel’s most elite special forces unit and a founder of Brothers in Arms, the Israeli activist coalition that mobilized veterans and reservists to oppose Netanyahu’s judicial coup. Immediately after the Hamas invasion, Brothers in Arms pivoted to organizing reservists and aid workers to get to the front — left, right, religious, secular, it didn’t matter — many hours before this incompetent government did. It’s a remarkable story of grass-roots mobilization that showed how much solidarity is still buried in this place and could be unlocked by a different prime minister, one who was a uniter, not a divider. Or as Scherf put it to me, “When you go to the front, you are overwhelmed by the power of what we lost.”",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,8,2412,0.409,0.366,0.467,0.116,0.5,0.18,0.235,0.564,0.186,0.5,0.5
185,45242,Marco Hernandez,The New York Times,The Tunnels of Gaza,"How the subterranean maze below the Gaza Strip works. The Gaza Strip has all the harrowing pitfalls soldiers have learned to expect from urban warfare: high-rise ambushes, truncated lines of sight and, everywhere, vulnerable civilians with nowhere to hide. But as Israeli ground forces inch their way forward in Gaza, the bigger danger may prove to be underfoot. The Hamas militants who launched a bloody attack on Israel last month have built a maze of hidden tunnels some believe extend across most if not all of Gaza, the territory they control. And they are not mere tunnels. Snaking beneath dense residential areas, the passageways allow fighters to move around free from the eye of the enemy. There are also bunkers for stockpiling weapons, food and water, and even command centers and tunnels wide enough for vehicles, researchers believe. Ordinary-looking doors and hatches serve as disguised access points, letting Hamas fighters dart out on missions and then slip back out of sight. No outsider has an exact map of the network, and few Israelis have seen it firsthand. But photos and video and reports from people who have been in the tunnels suggest the basic outlines of the system and how it is used. The source material includes photographs taken inside the passageways by journalists, accounts from researchers who study the tunnels, and details of the network that emerged from Israeli forces when they invaded Gaza in 2014. Dismantling the tunnels is a key part of Israel’s goal of wiping out Hamas’s leadership in the wake of the Oct. 7 attack. Israel has used the existence of the tunnels as justification for bombing civilian areas, including after a large Israeli airstrike hit a densely populated area in the Jabaliya neighborhood. Hamas has denied its tunnels were under some of the specific sites struck by Israel, and it is often impossible to verify Israel’s claims. To destroy tunnels on the ground, Israeli troops in Gaza will need to find entrances that are often hidden in the basements of civilian buildings, leading into concrete-lined tunnels, imagery suggests. They are typically just six and a half feet tall and three feet wide, experts said, forcing fighters to move through them single file. One 85-year-old Israeli woman who was held hostage for 17 days in the tunnels after being kidnapped on Oct. 7 described being marched through a “spider web” of wet and humid tunnels. She eventually reached a large hall where two dozen other hostages were being held, she said. There are still believed to be more than 200 Israeli hostages being held by Hamas, and many are likely in the very tunnels Israel aims to destroy. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that bringing them home is one of the two main aims of the invasion, the other being to “destroy Hamas.” The tunnels used for hiding Hamas equipment and fighters are not the only hidden passageways in Gaza. After Hamas came to power in 2007, and Israel tightened its blockade of the territory, an extensive network of smuggling tunnels grew under the border between Gaza and Egypt. These tunnels are used to circumvent the blockade and allow the import of a wide variety of goods, from weapons and electronic equipment to construction materials and fuel. The Egyptian authorities have made extensive efforts to destroy these smuggling routes, including pumping seawater to flood the network and collapse many of the tunnels. But some smuggling tunnels are still believed to be in operation. Although the Israeli military far surpasses Hamas’s in both size and equipment, fighting an enemy with its own network of tunnels is a high-risk undertaking. John W. Spencer, who studies urban warfare at the U.S. Military Academy’s Modern War Institute, describes it as more like “fighting under the sea than it is on the surface or inside of a building.” “Nothing that you use on the surface works,” he said recently on the Modern Warfare Project podcast. “You have to have specialized equipment to breathe, to see, to navigate, to communicate and to deploy lethal means, especially shooting.” One of the main dangers of going into the tunnels is that Hamas has booby-trapped the entrances with explosives, experts say. “The moment they realize the Israelis have entered the tunnels, they will just press the button and the entire thing could collapse on the Israelis,” said Ahron Bregman, a senior teaching fellow at King’s College London who specializes in the Arab-Israeli conflict. Israeli forces will probably not be able to destroy the entire tunnel network. “It is just too big, and there’s no point in dismantling all of it,” said Dr. Bregman. Instead, they will focus on blocking the entrances to the tunnels, likely by calling in airstrikes, or having engineers destroy them with explosives. They are also unlikely to take their fight underground — unless they believe they have no other choice. Entering the tunnels would strip Israeli forces of their advantages, Dr. Bregman said. At the moment, the Israelis are making headway with a mass of troops, tanks and helicopters. “The moment you get down to the tunnel, it is one against one,” he said.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4,855,0.288,0.211,0.41,0.357,0.5,0.127,0.087,0.5,0.161,0.5,0.5
186,45239,Mark Landler,The New York Times,Israel Accuses Freelance Photographers of Advance Knowledge of Oct. 7 Attack,"The New York Times said there was “no evidence” to support such claims about its freelancer. The Israeli government on Thursday accused freelance photographers for several major news organizations, including The New York Times, of being “accomplices” in the killing and abductions of Israeli soldiers and civilians by Hamas fighters — an allegation The Times vigorously denied about its freelancer. The government seized on a report by a pro-Israel media watchdog group, Honest Reporting, which has long accused The Times and other news organizations of anti-Israel bias in their coverage of Israel’s conflict with the Palestinians. “These journalists were accomplices in crimes against humanity,” the public diplomacy department of the prime minister’s office said in a tersely worded statement. “Their actions were contrary to professional ethics.” In its report, the watchdog group questioned why six Gaza-based photographers, all of whom were working for The Associated Press and Reuters, were early to document the incursion by Hamas into Israel on Oct. 7. The journalists photographed an Israeli tank that had been destroyed at the border of the Gaza Strip, soon after the militants broke through a fence and swarmed into Israeli territory. It said one of the photographers, Hassan Eslaiah, took pictures of a house burning in Kibbutz Kfar Azza, a target of the deadly attack by militants, while two others documented Hamas fighters transporting kidnapped Israelis back to Gaza. These harrowing images were all published by The Associated Press, as was a Reuters photo of a mob carrying the body of an Israeli soldier. While a fourth A.P. photographer named in the report, Yousef Masoud, has worked as a freelancer for The Times since shortly after the war began, he was not on assignment for the paper on the morning of Oct. 7, according to a statement issued by The Times. The Times rejected suggestions that it had advance warning of the attacks or had accompanied Hamas terrorists, calling the claims “untrue and outrageous.” It also said there was “no evidence for Honest Reporting’s insinuations” about Mr. Masoud.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11,338,0.159,0.122,0.126,0.5,0.5,0.128,0.154,0.5,0.142,0.5,0.5
187,45240,Omar Bartov,The New York Times,What I Believe as a Historian of Genocide,"Israeli military operations have created an untenable humanitarian crisis, which will only worsen over time. But are Israel’s actions — as the nation’s opponents argue — verging on ethnic cleansing or, most explosively, genocide? As a historian of genocide, I believe that there is no proof that genocide is currently taking place in Gaza, although it is very likely that war crimes, and even crimes against humanity, are happening. That means two important things: First, we need to define what it is that we are seeing, and second, we have the chance to stop the situation before it gets worse. We know from history that it is crucial to warn of the potential for genocide before it occurs, rather than belatedly condemn it after it has taken place. I think we still have that time. It is clear that the daily violence being unleashed on Gaza is both unbearable and untenable. Since the Oct. 7 massacre by Hamas — itself a war crime and a crime against humanity — Israel’s military air and ground assault on Gaza has killed more than 10,500 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, a number that includes thousands of children. That’s well over five times as many people as the more than 1,400 people in Israel murdered by Hamas. In justifying the assault, Israeli leaders and generals have made terrifying pronouncements that indicate a genocidal intent. Still, the collective horror of what we are watching does not mean that a genocide, according to the international legal definition of the term, is already underway. Because genocide, sometimes called “the crime of all crimes,” is perceived by many to be the most extreme of all crimes, there is often an impulse to describe any instance of mass murder and massacre as genocide. But this urge to label all atrocious events as genocide tends to obfuscate reality rather than explain it. International humanitarian law identifies several grave crimes in armed conflict. War crimes are defined in the 1949 Geneva Conventions and subsequent protocols as serious violations of the laws and customs of war in international armed conflict against both combatants and civilians. The Rome Statute, which established the International Criminal Court, defines crimes against humanity as extermination of, or other mass crimes against, any civilian population. The crime of genocide was defined in 1948 by the United Nations as “the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such.” So in order to prove that genocide is taking place, we need to show both that there is the intent to destroy and that destructive action is taking place against a particular group. Genocide as a legal concept differs from ethnic cleansing in that the latter, which has not been recognized as its own crime under international law, aims to remove a population from a territory, often violently, whereas genocide aims at destroying that population wherever it is. In reality, any of these situations — and especially ethnic cleansing — may escalate into genocide, as happened in the Holocaust, which began with an intention to remove the Jews from German-controlled territories and transformed into the intention of their physical extermination. My greatest concern watching the Israel-Gaza war unfold is that there is genocidal intent, which can easily tip into genocidal action. On Oct. 7, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Gazans would pay a “huge price” for the actions of Hamas and that the Israel Defense Forces, or I.D.F., would turn parts of Gaza’s densely populated urban centers “into rubble.” On Oct. 28, he added, citing Deuteronomy, “You must remember what Amalek did to you.” As many Israelis know, in revenge for the attack by Amalek, the Bible calls to “kill alike men and women, infants and sucklings.” The deeply alarming language does not end there. On Oct. 9, Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said, “We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly,” a statement indicating dehumanization, which has genocidal echoes. The next day, the head of the Israeli Army’s coordinator of government activities in the territories, Maj. Gen. Ghassan Alian, addressed the population of Gaza in Arabic: “Human animals must be treated as such,” he said, adding: “There will be no electricity and no water. There will only be destruction. You wanted hell, you will get hell.” The same day, retired Maj. Gen. Giora Eiland wrote in the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, “The State of Israel has no choice but to turn Gaza into a place that is temporarily or permanently impossible to live in.” He added, “Creating a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza is a necessary means to achieving the goal.” In another article, he wrote that “Gaza will become a place where no human being can exist.” Apparently, no army representative or politician denounced this statement. I could quote many more. Taken together, these statements could easily be construed as indicating a genocidal intent. But is genocide actually occurring? Israeli military commanders insist that they are trying to limit civilian casualties, and they attribute the large numbers of dead and wounded Palestinians to Hamas tactics of using civilians as human shields and placing their command centers under humanitarian structures like hospitals. But on Oct. 13, the Israeli Ministry of Intelligence reportedly issued a proposal to move the entire population of the Gaza Strip to the Egyptian-ruled Sinai Peninsula (Mr. Netanyahu’s office said it was a “concept paper”). Extreme right-wing elements in the government — also represented in the I.D.F. — celebrate the war as an opportunity to be rid of Palestinians altogether. This month, a videotape emerged on social media of Capt. Amichai Friedman, a rabbi in the Nahal Brigade, saying to a group of soldiers that it was now clear that “this land is ours, the whole land, including Gaza, including Lebanon.” The troops cheered enthusiastically; the military said that his conduct “does not align” with its values and directives. And so, while we cannot say that the military is explicitly targeting Palestinian civilians, functionally and rhetorically we may be watching an ethnic cleansing operation that could quickly devolve into genocide, as has happened more than once in the past. None of this happened in a vacuum. Over the past several months I have agonized greatly over the unfolding of events in Israel. On Aug. 4, several colleagues and I circulated a petition warning that the attempted judicial coup by the Netanyahu government was intended to perpetuate the Israeli occupation of Palestinian land. It was signed by close to 2,500 scholars, clergy members and public figures who were disgusted with the racist rhetoric of members of the government, its anti-democratic efforts and the growing violence by settlers, seemingly supported by the I.D.F., against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. What we had warned about — that it would be impossible to ignore the occupation and oppression of millions for 56 years, and the siege of Gaza for 16 years, without consequences — exploded in our faces on Oct. 7. Following Hamas’s massacre of innocent Jewish civilians, our same group issued a second petition denouncing the crimes committed by Hamas and calling upon the Israeli government to desist from perpetrating mass violence and killings upon innocent Palestinian civilians in Gaza in response to the crisis. We wrote that the only way to put an end to these cycles of violence is to seek a political compromise with the Palestinians and end the occupation. It is time for leaders and senior scholars of institutions dedicated to researching and commemorating the Holocaust to publicly warn against the rage- and vengeance-filled rhetoric that dehumanizes the population of Gaza and calls for its extinction. It is time to speak out against the escalating violence on the West Bank, perpetrated by Israeli settlers and I.D.F. troops, which now appears to also be sliding toward ethnic cleansing under the cover of war in Gaza; several Palestinian villages have reportedly self-evacuated under threats from settlers. I urge such venerable institutions as the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., and Yad Vashem in Jerusalem to step in now and stand at the forefront of those warning against war crimes, crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing and the crime of all crimes, genocide. If we truly believe that the Holocaust taught us a lesson about the need — or really, the duty — to preserve our own humanity and dignity by protecting those of others, this is the time to stand up and raise our voices, before Israel’s leadership plunges it and its neighbors into the abyss. There is still time to stop Israel from letting its actions become a genocide. We cannot wait a moment longer.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,8,1444,0.37,0.107,0.31,0.128,0.5,0.063,0.101,0.114,0.13,0.5,0.5
188,45241,Euan Ward,The New York Times,Hezbollah’s Leader Says Fighters Will Keep Up Pressure on Israel,"As clashes continue along Israel’s volatile border with Lebanon, Hassan Nasrallah said his group was now trying to hit targets deeper inside Israel with newer and more advanced weapons. The head of Lebanon’s powerful Hezbollah militia, Hassan Nasrallah, said on Saturday that his group intended to keep up pressure on Israel and claimed that it was striking deeper into Israeli territory with powerful new weapons. Since war erupted more than a month ago between Israel and Hamas, the armed Palestinian group that controls Gaza, Israel and Hezbollah have clashed repeatedly along Israel’s northern border with Lebanon. Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran and share the goal of eradicating Israel. But in the assessment of analysts, Israel and Hezbollah appeared to be calibrating their actions to avoid setting off what Israeli officials fear could become a broader regional war. Mr. Nasrallah has previously described Hezbollah’s objective as a controlled battle along the border aimed at sapping Israel’s morale and resources. Mr. Nasrallah once again stopped short on Saturday of calling for an immediate, all-out regional war, echoing remarks he made in a speech last week, though he continued to dangle the threat. For now, Hezbollah — along with militant groups from the West Bank and Yemen — will instead continue to support Hamas by keeping Israeli forces engaged on multiple fronts. “The pressure must continue,” Mr. Nasrallah said during his televised address in Lebanon, adding that events on the battlefield would dictate whether this would grow into a bigger conflict. “We are in a battle of steadfastness and patience.” As clashes continued along Israel’s increasingly volatile border with Lebanon, the Hezbollah leader said his group was now trying to hit targets deeper inside Israel with newer and more advanced weapons. “There has been a quantitative improvement in terms of the number of operations and the type of weapon used,” he claimed, adding that Hezbollah for the first time had used drones and powerful new missiles and rockets — some of them containing as much as 500 kilograms of explosives — or roughly 1,100 pounds — against Israeli forces in recent days. Hezbollah has also increasingly deployed surface-to-air missiles against Israeli drones, which have caused heavy casualties among Hezbollah fighters in recent weeks, according to the Israeli military. In response to what the Israelis noted was an uptick in attacks by Hezbollah with more sophisticated weaponry, the Israeli military stepped up its airstrikes inside Lebanon on Friday evening, targeting Hezbollah weapons depots and intelligence infrastructure after a series of Hezbollah attacks using self-destructing drones and missiles seriously injured four Israeli soldiers. Last week, after an Israeli drone strike killed a woman and three girls in southern Lebanon, Hezbollah also fired a barrage of Grad rockets at the northern Israeli city of Kiryat Shmona, a first for the group since the fighting began.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,10,471,0.406,0.34,0.612,0.5,0.5,0.184,0.35,0.15,0.15,0.5,0.5
189,45243,Farnaz Fassihi,The New York Times,U.N. says that without fuel it can no longer distribute humanitarian aid.,"The lack of fuel, used to operate the fork lifts that unload the goods and the trucks that deliver them, is imperiling the only lifeline for the 2.2 million people in the coastal enclave. The United Nations said on Monday that its already dwindling reserve of fuel in the Gaza Strip would run out as soon as Tuesday, preventing the organization from receiving and distributing the desperately needed aid trickling in, and imperiling the only lifeline for the 2.2 million people in the coastal enclave. The U.N.’s agency for aiding Palestinians, UNRWA, has been the main coordinator of humanitarian aid crossing into Gaza from Egypt since Israel placed Gaza under siege. Trucks carrying essential goods such as water, food, medicine and hygienic products go to U.N. warehouses in Gaza, where they are unloaded and distributed in other trucks by the U.N. and humanitarian agency partners, the U.N. said. Andrea De Domenico, the head of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs for Palestinian territories, told reporters on Monday that as of Tuesday the U.N. will no longer have enough fuel to operate either the fork lifts that unload the goods or the trucks that distribute them. As part of its offensive against Hamas, Israel has cut off electricity to Gaza and blocked the delivery of fuel, saying Hamas uses it for rocket attacks and has stockpiled fuel intended for civilians. More than one million Gazans have been displaced, and civilians are running perilously low on basic human necessities. “Instead of a much-needed increase of this assistance, we have been informed by colleagues of UNRWA that, due to the lack of fuel, as of tomorrow the operations of receiving trucks will no longer be possible,” Mr. De Domenico said from Jerusalem. A total of 980 trucks carrying essential aid have crossed into Gaza from Egypt, including 76 trucks on Sunday, Mr. De Domenico said. But the U.N. has said far more is needed. Before Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, about 500 trucks of humanitarian aid crossed into Gaza daily. The U.N. is worried that the fuel shortage could impede its humanitarian operations and the ability of hospitals, which rely on generators in the absence of power, to treat patients. Gaza’s main hospital, Al-Shifa, has reported that the lack of fuel was putting patients in intensive care at risk of dying and that premature babies were taken out of incubators that were now useless. Three babies and two cardiology patients had died as of Monday, according to Al-Shifa officials. Al-Shifa’s critical infrastructure — including its water tanks, oxygen stations, maternity ward and cardiovascular facilities — was damaged by the fighting, Mr. De Domenico said. Three nurses were killed, he said. Operational conditions for U.N. staff and humanitarian workers in Gaza were deteriorating by the hour, Mr. De Domenico said. Even if fuel were delivered outside, it would be too dangerous for hospital staff members to retrieve it, he said, because of snipers in the area. “Lives in Gaza are hanging by a thread due to the shortage of fuel and medical supplies,” he said. The U.N. lowered its flag to half-staff at its headquarters in New York on Monday, observing a minute of silence at its agencies around the world for its 101 staff members killed in Gaza since Oct. 7. The U.N. secretary general, António Guterres, has said it is the most U.N. staff members killed in a conflict since the organization was established in 1945. Mr. Guterres has been negotiating with officials and colleagues to resolve the fuel situation, which has become a priority for the organization, a U.N. spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric, said. “We shouldn’t have to negotiate for fuel,” Mr. Dujarric said.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,12,616,0.145,0.262,0.361,0.5,0.5,0.069,0.389,0.287,0.267,0.5,0.5

Says","The agency warned of a “dire and perilous” situation for those trapped inside as Israeli troops battle Hamas fighters nearby. Gaza’s Al-Shifa Hospital is no longer functioning, according to the World Health Organization, which warned of a “dire and perilous” situation for hundreds of patients and displaced people trapped inside as Israeli troops battle Hamas fighters nearby. The W.H.O. said on Sunday that three days “without electricity, without water and with very poor internet” had severely hurt Al-Shifa’s ability to provide care. It cited constant gunfire and bombings in the area, and said patient deaths had increased significantly. “Regrettably, the hospital is not functioning as a hospital anymore,” the agency’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said in a statement. The health ministry in Gaza said that at least six wounded patients had died at the hospital, Gaza’s main hospital, on Saturday as a result of a power outage, including two premature babies. Without fuel to run generators, the hospital has been plunged into darkness, the ministry and the hospital’s administrator said. Israeli security officials say that Hamas has built a vast command complex under the hospital, making it a legitimate military target. Hamas has denied the allegations, as has Al-Shifa’s director, Dr. Mohammed Abu Salmiya, who has called them “untrue.” In recent days, Israeli soldiers have surrounded at least one other hospital in northern Gaza, stepping up their push to empty the facilities, according to Israeli military officials, as fighting around them intensifies. At Al-Rantisi Specialized Hospital for Children, the only medical center with a pediatric cancer ward in the strip, Dr. Bakr Gaoud, the head of the hospital, said Israeli forces moved in late last week, damaging the ground floor and destroying several vehicles before providing maps that showed a safe evacuation route, which patients and staff soon used. A second hospital, Al-Nasr, was similarly emptied out by Israel on Friday, and the health ministry reported strikes against other hospitals over the weekend. At Al-Quds Hospital, “heavy gunfire” was continuing nearby, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society said on Monday, and that “shelling and violent explosions were heard in the area.” A convoy of vehicles that had been traveling from the south to Al-Quds in an effort to evacuate patients and medical staff could not reach the hospital because of the bombardment, the agency said.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,9,385,0.123,0.075,0.183,0.5,0.5,0.12,0.205,0.175,0.079,0.5,0.5
191,45240,Anemona Hartocollis,The New York Times,"Harvard, Columbia and Penn Pledge to Fight Antisemitism on Campus","The universities are trying to address criticism by banning pro-Palestinian student groups, condemning slogans and starting task forces to address antisemitism. Over the last month, university presidents have been battered by a vocal cohort of alumni and faculty members who have accused them of not being strong enough in their denunciations of antisemitism in the wake of the Hamas attack on Israel. Now at some high-profile universities that have faced heavy criticism — including Harvard, Columbia and the University of Pennsylvania — presidents are trying to take more direct action to address those concerns about antisemitism. Columbia suspended two pro-Palestinian student groups on Friday. At Harvard on Thursday, the university’s president, Claudine Gay, condemned the phrase “from the river to the sea,” which has been called divisive and antisemitic. At the University of Pennsylvania, the president, Elizabeth Magill, spoke forcefully against antisemitic rhetoric. And all three universities formed task forces to address antisemitism on campus. “Let me reiterate what I and other Harvard leaders have said previously: Antisemitism has no place at Harvard,” Dr. Gay wrote in an announcement on Thursday. “While confronting any form of hatred is daunting, the challenges we face tackling antisemitism are made all the more so by its pernicious nature and deep historical roots. But we are committed to doing the hard work to address this scourge.” Their moves, however, may not quell the anger among donors. And the actions may only fuel the resolve among pro-Palestinian student activists, who say that they are only speaking up for marginalized, oppressed people living in Gaza. The criticism, they say, is nothing but an attempt to stifle speech and divert attention from a 16-year blockade of Gaza by Israel, backed by Egypt, that has devastated the lives of Palestinians. In addition, many pro-Palestinian students point out that they have faced doxxing and harassment — and they are asking on social media for similar efforts against Islamophobia. Columbia announced on Friday that it would ban Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace through the end of the fall term, saying that they had violated university policies. The groups have been at the center of weeks of intense demonstrations that have sharply divided students and shaken Columbia’s Manhattan campus. The most recent action, including a walkout, attracted roughly 300 students on Thursday. Gerald Rosberg, the university’s executive vice president, said in a statement that Thursday’s event “included threatening rhetoric and intimidation” and that the groups had taken their actions “despite warnings” not to do so.The university’s decision will bar the group from holding events on campus or receiving university funding through the end of the fall semester. “During this especially charged time on our campus, we are strongly committed to giving space to student groups to participate in debate, advocacy and protest,” Mr. Rosberg said. But, he added, groups would have to abide by university rules that require them to receive approval for large gatherings and cooperate with the administration. Sonya Meyerson-Knox, communications director for Jewish Voice for Peace, a pro-Palestinian group, called Columbia’s action a “horrific act of censorship and an attempt at intimidation,” adding that the students from both groups were doing exactly what they should do — “standing up against war and calling for a cease-fire to save lives.” Although universities have occasionally tussled with S.J.P. chapters over the years, Columbia’s decision was at least the second punitive action against the network this week. On Monday, Brandeis University, near Boston, banned its local S.J.P. chapter from holding activities on campus. In a notice to the group obtained by The New York Times, Brandeis accused the national steering committee of encouraging chapters “in conduct that supports Hamas in its call for the violent elimination of Israel and the Jewish people.” Such behavior, the notice said, was “not protected by the university’s principles.”  ",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10,638,0.46,0.219,0.183,0.5,0.5,0.097,0.087,0.196,0.086,0.5,0.5

193,45235,Julian Barnes,The New York Times,C.I.A. Director Visits Israel and the Middle East Amid Israel-Hamas War,"William J. Burns’s visit comes as the United States tries to prod Israel to pursue a more targeted approach to attacking Hamas, allow pauses in the fighting and do more to avoid civilian casualties. William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, arrived in Israel on Sunday for discussions with leaders and intelligence officials, the first stop in a multicountry trip in the region, according to U.S. officials. The visit comes as the United States is trying to prod Israel to pursue a more targeted approach to attacking Hamas, allow pauses in the fighting for aid to enter Gaza and do more to avoid civilian casualties. The United States is also looking to expand its intelligence sharing with Israel, providing information that could be useful about hostage locations or any follow-on attacks by Hamas. A U.S. official briefed on Mr. Burns’s trip said he planned to reinforce the American commitment to intelligence cooperation with partners in the region. Mr. Burns will travel to several Middle Eastern countries for discussions about the situation in Gaza, ongoing hostage negotiations and the importance of deterring the war with Hamas from widening to a broader context, the U.S. official said. U.S. officials have been visiting Israel at a regular cadence since war broke out after Hamas fighters attacked Israeli towns on Oct. 7 and killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians. Israel has retaliated with a punishing air campaign and ground invasion into Gaza, where Hamas is in control. More than 9,000 Palestinians have been killed in airstrikes since Israel began retaliating, according to Gaza’s health ministry. U.S. officials said their estimates of the number of Palestinians killed were similar. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken arrived on Friday to make the case to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and key national security officials that there are more effective ways to cripple Hamas than the intense air campaign. A spokeswoman for the C.I.A. said the agency does not comment on the director’s travel. Mr. Burns, who has extensive experience in the region, visited as key intelligence leaders in Israel have been heavily criticized for failing to detect the attack and the threat from Hamas more broadly. As one of the Biden administration’s most trusted voices on Middle East issues, Mr. Burns has become something of a roving troubleshooting diplomat for the White House. The visits by American officials, particularly President Biden, have made an impact on Israelis, many of whom have been frustrated with Mr. Netanyahu’s handling of the crisis. Still, there are tensions between Israeli officials and their American counterparts, as the United States pushes Israel to embrace a military campaign that takes more care to minimize civilian casualties. American officials say they are not telling Israelis what to do, but they are advising them about their own experiences with the Iraq war and drilling into Mr. Netanyahu’s government the importance of not imitating America’s missteps after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Mr. Burns’s visit to Arab countries may be as important as his meetings in Israel. His exact itinerary is unclear, but he is expected to visit Jordan. King Abdullah II canceled a meeting with Mr. Biden after a blast at a Gaza hospital led to high casualties. While the United States and Israel have blamed Hamas for the explosion, Hamas has said Israel is responsible. Much of Jordan’s population is ethnically Palestinian, putting the country, a close U.S. ally that has a peace treaty with Israel, in an especially tricky position as it navigates the fallout from the war. Mr. Burns has a particularly close relationship with King Abdullah. He was the ambassador to Jordan when King Hussein died and Abdullah ascended to the throne.

194,45237,Maria Abi-Habib,The New York Times,Israel and Hamas Nearly Struck a Deal to Free Up to 50 Hostages,"Indirect talks mediated by Qatar snagged after Israel’s ground invasion of Gaza on Oct. 27. They have resumed, but hopes for a quick release have faded. Days before Israel launched its ground invasion of Gaza, it was closing in on a deal for Hamas to release up to 50 hostages in exchange for pausing the bombardment unleashed in response to the militants’ Oct. 7 attacks in Israel, according to Arab and Western officials with knowledge of the talks. But once Israel’s ground assault on Gaza got underway on Oct. 27, the negotiations came to an abrupt halt, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations. The talks resumed days later and are still underway. Israel had delayed its ground attack to give some time for the hostage negotiations to be completed, according to two of the officials. But as the talks stalled, it decided to go forward, reckoning that Hamas, the armed Palestinian group that rules Gaza, would bow to military pressure. “There will be no pause without the return of hostages and missing persons,” Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said in a written statement to The New York Times this week. “The only way of saving the hostages is if Israel continues its ground operation.” On Oct. 7, Palestinian attackers penetrated towns and military bases in southern Israel and killed roughly 1,400 people. They also took about 240 captives back to Gaza, including civilians and Israeli soldiers. Hamas leaders have since claimed that their group does not have control over all of those captives because other Gaza factions, including Palestinian Islamic Jihad, also entered Israel that day and took some hostages of their own. So far, the negotiations have only focused on releasing civilian hostages, according to these officials. The Israeli soldiers held in Gaza may eventually be part of a separate track of negotiations, possibly to be exchanged for hundreds of Palestinian women and minors who are held without charge in Israeli prisons. The deal was being worked out in the tiny Gulf emirate of Qatar, which has hosted the Hamas political leadership in exile for years.

195,45235,Isabel Kershner,The New York Times,Israel accuses Hamas of operating out of 2 more Gaza hospitals.,"The World Health Organization said on Sunday that it had documented more than 100 attacks on the health care system in Gaza, as the Israeli military said Hamas fighters were using two additional hospitals in the enclave to conceal their operations. Fourteen hospitals in the enclave — including 10 in the densely populated area of Gaza City — are no longer operating, according to the W.H.O. arm operating in the Palestinian territories. The W.H.O. called for “active protection of civilians and health care,” in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. Israeli officials continued to insist on Sunday that Hamas was using health centers in the area as human shields. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the chief spokesman for the Israeli military, said Hamas was “cynically” and “systematically” exploiting medical facilities. A little more than a week after Israeli officials said they had identified Al Shifa, Gaza’s largest and most advanced hospital, as being used by Hamas for underground command and control centers, Admiral Hagari presented what he said was evidence that the armed group was using two others — Sheikh Hamad, north of Gaza City, and Indonesian, in northern Gaza — essentially as cover. Admiral Hagari presented images and videos of what he said was the opening to a Hamas tunnel under Sheikh Hamad Hospital and gunmen opening fire on Israeli ground forces from within the hospital. He also said there was an underground Hamas command and control center under Indonesian Hospital, and showed aerial images of what he said were rocket launchpads about 80 yards from its grounds. Hamas placed them there, he said, knowing that any airstrike against the launchpads would damage the hospital. The images could not be independently verified. Admiral Hagari said that Israel had shared them with “other agencies.” In making the earlier accusations about Al Shifa, Admiral Hagari had presented an illustrated map of that hospital and, citing intelligence sources that he did not release, described areas of the complex and underground installations that he said were used as command centers by Hamas. Hamas officials denied the accusation at the time, saying that Israel had failed to provide any evidence. Israeli and Palestinian claims and counterclaims about the hospitals have become a flashpoint in the war, not least because many of the facilities have become refuges for displaced Gazans who believe they are safer than other alternatives. The Palestine Red Crescent Society, an independent aid group, said on Sunday that Israel was continuing to bombard the area around Al Quds Hospital in the Tel al-Hawa neighborhood of southern Gaza City. Israel has not publicly identified that hospital, which is run by the Red Crescent group, as harboring Hamas military infrastructure. The Red Crescent group said that Israeli forces had intensified their attacks on the hospital’s vicinity, where it said that artillery and aerial bombardments “from all directions” over the past week had injured 47 displaced people sheltering in the hospital as well as two patients in its intensive care unit. On Saturday, a strike hit near the entrance of the hospital’s emergency room, according to the group. A surgeon there, Dr. Nabil al-Shawa, said 21 people had been wounded. About 14,000 displaced people have been sheltering at the hospital in recent days, and another 500 were being treated there, the aid society said, adding that the bombardment had caused significant damage to the hospital’s critical care unit and water supply lines. The World Health Organization said in a statement on Saturday that an attack was reported near the Indonesian Hospital, but it did not provide any details. The W.H.O.’s statement condemned attacks near Al Quds Hospital and an Israeli airstrike on Friday that hit near the entrance of Al Shifa Hospital and, according to Gazan and Israeli officials, killed multiple people. The Palestine Red Crescent Society said the strike came as a convoy of ambulances trying to carry wounded people to the Gaza border was returning to the hospital. The convoy, the group said, had turned back after reaching a crater on its southbound road. The Israeli military said it had carried out the strike on an ambulance being used by Hamas and had killed a number of operatives. “We strike based on intelligence,” Admiral Hagari said on Sunday. “We do not want to strike hospitals and ambulances,” he said. He added, “We are fighting to defeat Hamas, to free our hostages and to free Gaza from Hamas.”",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,11,735,0.122,0.145,0.23,0.5,0.5,0.179,0.252,0.231,0.163,0.5,0.5

The House voted on Tuesday to censure Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, formally rebuking the sole Palestinian American in Congress for her statements regarding the Israel-Hamas war. Twenty-two Democrats joined most Republicans to pass the resolution, which accuses Ms. Tlaib of “promoting false narratives” surrounding Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel and of “calling for the destruction of the state of Israel.” The vote was 234 to 188. Four Republicans voted against censuring Ms. Tlaib, while one Democrat and three Republicans voted “present,” declining to take a position... It also cited Ms. Tlaib’s embrace of the phrase “from the river to the sea,” a pro-Palestinian rallying cry that many regard as calling for the eradication of Israel and has been deemed antisemitic by the Anti-Defamation League. The resolution called the phrase “a genocidal call to violence to destroy the state of Israel and its people to replace it with a Palestinian state extending from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea.” Ms. Tlaib has said the slogan, which was used by pro-Palestinian protesters featured in a video she posted accusing President Biden of supporting genocide in Gaza, is “an aspirational call for freedom, human rights and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction or hate.” “I can’t believe I have to say this, but Palestinian people are not disposable,” she said, appearing to choke back tears as Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, stood up to comfort her. “The cries of the Palestinian and Israeli children sound no different to me.”",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,10,276,0.242,0.225,0.217,0.5,0.5,0.212,0.23,0.248,0.302,0.5,0.5

On Friday, an Israeli airstrike targeted an ambulance near the entrance of Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, killing at least 13 people, according to Gazan authorities. The ambulance was part of a convoy of ambulances carrying wounded people to the border in the hope of crossing into Egypt. Officials at the Rafah crossing on Saturday told people waiting to leave Gaza that Israel had refused to coordinate the safe passage of several ambulances from Gaza City to the border. Hundreds of people are waiting at the crossing, many of them families, including some Egyptian, French and German passport holders. Some have been there for days. “No foreign passport holders will travel from the Gaza Strip until the coordinated evacuation of the wounded from hospitals in Gaza and the north toward the Rafah crossing,” said Wael Abu Omar, a spokesman for the authorities on the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to the charge that it was refusing to allow the safe passage of ambulances to the border. In recent days, a number of severely injured people have been taken by ambulance from Gaza to Egypt for medical treatment. The Israeli military said the ambulance hit on Friday was being used by Hamas, the armed group that controls Gaza, and claimed it had killed a number of Hamas fighters in the strike.

199,45238,Vivian Nereim,The New York Times,Arab States Intensify Pleas for Gaza Cease-fire as Public Anger Mounts,"Citing deepening fears for regional stability, Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries are beseeching the U.S. to push Israel to end its military campaign in Gaza. Facing growing anger from their own people, Arab countries are intensifying their appeals to the United States to pressure Israel to implement an immediate cease-fire in Gaza or risk sabotaging the security of the entire Middle East. Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt have all implored American officials, including Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, to get Israel to halt its military assault. “The whole region is sinking in a sea of hatred that will define generations to come,” the Jordanian foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, warned at a news conference this weekend. As unrest spills into the streets and fear spreads that Iran-backed militias in the region will enter more directly into the conflict, some Arab leaders are worrying for their own security, said Elham Fakhro, an associate fellow at Chatham House’s Middle East and North Africa Program. “Long-term resentment among the Arab public is fuel for extremist groups,” she said. “The region is already walking a delicate balance,” she added. “This is what drives Arab governments to use their available leverage to call for a cease-fire.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has so far rejected calls for even a temporary cease-fire until hostages are released by Hamas, the armed Palestinian group that broke through the Israeli fence surrounding Gaza on Oct. 7 and launched a brazen attack, killing roughly 1,400 people, according to Israeli authorities. The attackers also took about 240 people hostage. Israeli officials have insisted that their military campaign must destroy Hamas, which rules Gaza and is estimated to have tens of thousands of fighters inside the territory. But Arab officials and scholars who study the Iran-backed militia argue that goal is not only impossible, but counterproductive in that it would likely generate even more violence. This weekend, Arab countries will gather in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, for a summit where the conflict — and their response to it — will top the agenda. Saudi Arabia will also host an extraordinary meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation that President Ebrahim Raisi of Iran is expected to attend — his first trip to the kingdom since Saudi Arabia and Iran restored diplomatic ties earlier this year. His visit would be another sign of how the war has united disparate voices across the Muslim world in solidarity with the Palestinians. Even officials in the United Arab Emirates — which led a push for Arab countries to build ties with Israel in 2020 — have condemned Israel’s conduct in the war. “As we continue working to stop this war, we cannot ignore the wider context, and the necessity to turn down the regional temperature that is approaching a boiling point,” Noura al-Kaabi, an Emirati minister of state for foreign affairs, said recently...A senior Saudi official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said that it would be basically impossible for Arab countries to consider the topic until there is a cease-fire. Participating in discussions about Gaza’s future would make it look like Arab states are “giving Israel a way out,” said Abdulaziz Alghashian, a Saudi scholar who studies his country’s foreign policy toward Israel. “That is something they want to avoid at all costs.” Despite that, the standoff is a far cry from 50 years ago, when resource-rich Arab countries imposed an oil embargo on the United States in part to pressure it over its support for Israel. “We are seeing civilian deaths on an alarming scale,” said Kristin Diwan, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. “Yet no Arab state has issued a public ultimatum or cut ties with Israel.” She attributed that to an unwillingness to jeopardize their relations with Israel or the United States. Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries are pushing for a return to an Israeli-Palestinian peace process once the war is over — and the creation of a Palestinian state. The senior Saudi official said that every government he talks to has the same focus now — finding a way to change the status quo.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11,699,0.351,0.207,0.236,0.125,0.5,0.119,0.238,0.165,0.203,0.5,0.5
200,45236,Nick Cumming-Bruce,The New York Times,U.N. Says Israel-Gaza War Is Deadliest Ever for Its Personnel,"The U.N. secretary general, António Guterres, said Monday that 89 employees of UNRWA, its agency aiding Palestinian refugees, had been killed since the war began. The United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, said on Monday that 89 employees of the U.N. agency aiding Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, had been killed in Gaza in the month of war between Israel and Hamas. That is more “than in any comparable period in the history of our organization,” he told reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York, adding that many of the employees had been killed with members of their family. The United Nations employs large numbers of Palestinians in Gaza, where almost half the working-age population is unemployed. On Sunday, the leaders of United Nations agencies and other humanitarian groups issued a joint statement calling for an immediate cease-fire, saying, “Enough is enough. This must stop now.” In the statement, they expressed “shock and horror” at the loss of life and called for the immediate release of hostages taken during the Hamas attacks in Israel last month. They noted that “more than 100 attacks against health care” had been reported and that “scores of aid workers” had been killed since the attacks and Israel’s retaliatory airstrikes on Gaza. Of the loss of U.N. staff members, Juliette Touma, a spokeswoman for UNRWA, said: “The number goes up every day.” “They are killed in the north, the middle and the south, men and women, some at home, some at displacement shelters, some bringing refugees to the shelters,” she added. One staff member was killed as he waited in line for bread, she said, and another was killed at home with his wife and eight children. Most worked in the agency’s schools in Gaza, she said. The World Health Organization said 16 health care workers had died while on duty in Gaza, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said its member organizations had lost seven staff members in the war. The fatalities, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said, included three medical staff of Magen David Adom, Israel’s emergency medical service, who were killed as they tried to rescue people from the kibbutzim under attack by Hamas and take them to the hospital.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10,378,0.079,0.184,0.097,0.5,0.5,0.098,0.089,0.163,0.11,0.5,0.5
201,45234,Lisa Lerer,The New York Times,Obama Urges Americans to Take in ‘Whole Truth’ of Israel-Gaza War,"The former president said everyone was “complicit to some degree” in the current bloodshed and acknowledged the points of view on both sides of the conflict. Barack Obama offered a complex analysis of the conflict between Israel and Gaza, telling thousands of former aides that they were all “complicit to some degree” in the current bloodshed. “I look at this, and I think back, ‘What could I have done during my presidency to move this forward, as hard as I tried?’” he said in an interview conducted by his former staffers for their podcast, Pod Save America. “But there’s a part of me that’s still saying, ‘Well, was there something else I could have done?’” Mr. Obama entered the White House convinced he could be the president who would resolve the decades-old conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. He left office after years of friction and mistrust with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who was frustrated by the president’s masterminding of the Iran nuclear deal and by his demands that Israel suspend new settlements. In his comments on Friday, delivered at a gathering of his former staff in Chicago, Mr. Obama acknowledged the strong emotions the war had raised, saying that “this is century-old stuff that’s coming to the fore.” He blamed social media for amplifying the divisions and reducing a thorny international dispute to what he viewed as sloganeering. Yet he urged his former aides to “take in the whole truth,” seemingly attempting to strike a balance between the killings on both sides. “What Hamas did was horrific, and there’s no justification for it,” Mr. Obama said. “And what is also true is that the occupation and what’s happening to Palestinians is unbearable.” He continued: “And what is also true is that there is a history of the Jewish people that may be dismissed unless your grandparents or your great-grandparents, or your uncle or your aunt tell you stories about the madness of antisemitism. And what is true is that there are people right now who are dying, who have nothing to do with what Hamas did.” Still, Mr. Obama appeared to acknowledge the limits of his musings about bridging divides and embracing complexity. “Even what I just said, which sounds very persuasive, still doesn’t answer the fact of, all right, how do we prevent kids from being killed today?” he said. “But the problem is that if you are dug in on that, well, the other side is dug in remembering the videos that Hamas took or what they did on the 7th, and they’re dug in, too, which means we will not stop those kids from dying.”",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,11,440,0.505,0.412,0.164,0.182,0.5,0.112,0.243,0.5,0.299,0.5,0.5
202,45238,Eric Schmitt,The New York Times,U.S. Strikes Iran-Linked Facility in Syria in Round of Retaliation,"Drone and rocket attacks on U.S. forces have continued in recent weeks, prompting a second round of retaliatory airstrikes in eastern Syria. For the second time in nearly two weeks, the United States carried out airstrikes against a facility used by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and its proxies in eastern Syria early Thursday, ratcheting up retaliation for a steady stream of rocket and drone attacks against American forces in Iraq and Syria. The strikes by two Air Force F-15E jets against a weapons warehouse in Deir al Zour Province, Syria, came after U.S. airstrikes on Oct. 27 against similar targets in eastern Syria failed to deter Iran or its proxies in Syria and Iraq, which the Biden administration has blamed for the attacks. Not only have the attacks continued — there have been at least 22 more since the American retaliatory strikes last month — but Pentagon officials said they have become more dangerous. Iran-backed militias have packed even larger loads of explosives — more than 80 pounds — onto drones launched at American bases, U.S. officials said. “This precision self-defense strike is a response to a series of attacks against U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria by I.R.G.C.-Quds Force affiliates,” Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III said in a statement. “The president has no higher priority than the safety of U.S. personnel, and he directed today’s action to make clear that the United States will defend itself, its personnel, and its interests.” “The United States is fully prepared to take further necessary measures to protect our people and our facilities,” he added. “We urge against any escalation.” The strikes also came after the Pentagon said a U.S. military MQ-9 Reaper surveillance drone was shot down over the Red Sea off the coast of Yemen on Wednesday by Iran-backed Houthi rebels. The downing of the drone, the mainstay of the American military’s aerial surveillance fleet, was another escalation of violence between the United States and Iran-backed groups in the region. The episode underscored the risks that the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas could spiral into a wider war. Biden administration officials have been trying to calculate how to deter the Iranian-backed Shiite militias from attacking American troops in the region without sparking that broader conflict, said three administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning. “The attacks, the threats coming from militia that are aligned with Iran, are totally unacceptable,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said in Iraq on Sunday. The Pentagon said on Wednesday that there had been at least 41 attacks on U.S. forces in Syria and Iraq since Oct. 17 and that at least 46 U.S. service members had been injured, 25 of whom had suffered traumatic brain injuries. The United States has 2,500 troops in Iraq and 900 in Syria, mostly to help local forces fight remnants of the Islamic State. In meetings to select targets, U.S. officials try to game out what response each strike will bring, one official said. Military officials at the Pentagon’s Central Command and in the American intelligence community have a good idea where many militia leaders are, two officials said, and have, in the past two weeks, considered the possible blowback if targeted airstrikes were to kill those leaders. The effort to calibrate retaliation is inexact, the officials acknowledged. The strike against the weapons warehouse early Thursday was aimed at “disrupting and degrading” the abilities of the militias to carry out attacks against American troops, a senior Pentagon official told reporters after the strike. But the strike was carried out late at night in Syria when the chances of hitting any Iranian personnel or militia fighters were small, Pentagon officials said.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10,621,0.368,0.191,0.448,0.5,0.5,0.073,0.073,0.073,0.5,0.5,0.5
203,45233,Ben Hubbard,The New York Times,"In High-Stakes Speech, Hezbollah’s Leader Stops Short of Call to Expand Hamas War","In his first public comments since the war in Gaza began, Hassan Nasrallah said his powerful Lebanese militia had bogged down Israeli forces to help Hamas. Since the war in Gaza began after Hamas’s surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7, people across the Middle East have feared it could set off a second war between Israel and Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese militia, and ignite a broader regional conflagration. That is not Hezbollah’s plan, the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said in a widely anticipated address to his followers on Friday, his first public remarks since the start of the war. He warned, however, that Hezbollah’s forces were ready for anything. Hezbollah, he said, was already doing what it set out to do: exchanging fire with a portion of Israel’s military to keep it tied up along the northern border with Lebanon, reducing the burden on Hamas. “The Lebanese front has lessened a large part of the forces that were going to escalate the attack on Gaza,” Mr. Nasrallah said. “Some in Lebanon say that we are taking a risk, it’s true. But this risk is part of a beneficial, correct calculation.” But he added that he was keeping Hezbollah’s forces prepared should hostilities with Israel escalate. “All the possibilities on our Lebanese front are open,” he said. “All the choices are available and we could resort to them at any time.” Israel and Hezbollah have clashed repeatedly along the Israel-Lebanon border since the war began, targeting each other’s positions and killing combatants on both sides. Mr. Nasrallah’s address, which lasted more than an hour and repeatedly erupted into fiery crescendos, was far from a call for peace. But it fit with analysts’ assessment that Israel and Hezbollah appeared to be calibrating their actions to avoid setting off a broader war. Mr. Nasrallah described Hezbollah’s objective as a controlled battle along the border aimed at sapping Israel's morale and resources. That message was most likely a disappointment to Hamas, a Hezbollah ally that is also supported by Iran, some of whose leaders have called on their regional partners to do more in the fight against Israel. Israel, the United States and other countries consider both groups terrorist organizations. During one of the most tense periods in the Middle East in recent years, though, Mr. Nasrallah’s speech offered a small measure of relief for many, that at least one powerful force was not seeking to plunge the region into even greater violence. Hezbollah is a more powerful and sophisticated military force than Hamas, with tens of thousands of trained fighters, an arsenal of more than 100,000 rockets and a stock of precision-guided missiles that can strike sensitive targets deep inside Israel. Military analysts believe that the group may also have other military capabilities that it has yet to unveil. Mr. Nasrallah is a highly respected figure inside a group that calls itself the “axis of resistance,” a network of Iranian-backed militias in several Arab countries that share an anti-American and anti-Israeli ideology and have come to coordinate their operations more closely in recent years. A decision by Hezbollah to launch a full-on war with Israel would most likely encourage attacks by an assortment of allied militias in Iraq, Syria and Yemen. During his address, which was live-streamed to large gatherings of Hezbollah supporters around Lebanon, Mr. Nasrallah lashed out at the United States for its staunch support for Israel, accusing President Biden of dishonesty in telling Israel that it had the right to defend itself but that it had to respect human rights. “Empty talk! Hypocrisy!” Mr. Nasrallah boomed. He also said the group was not intimidated by the two aircraft carriers that the United States had dispatched to the eastern Mediterranean, which could strike Hezbollah targets. “Your fleets in the Mediterranean do not scare us and will never scare us,” Mr. Nasrallah said. “Your fleets that you threaten us with, we are prepared for them as well.” Should the United States intervene directly in the war, Mr. Nasrallah said, it could expect attacks by Hezbollah’s allies on its military bases and other targets in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. The U.S. military has said the carriers were sent to deter a wider regional war — a fear that has grown alongside mounting anger in Arab countries over the crisis facing Gazan civilians and the death toll in the strip, which has risen into the many thousands since Israel’s bombardment began. Israel has faced increasing international criticism over the dire conditions in Gaza, but has so far resisted calls for either a cease-fire or humanitarian “pauses” to help deliver aid. Mr. Nasrallah praised the fighters from his and other armed groups in Lebanon, saying they were launching daily attacks on Israeli military positions and destroying communications infrastructure. Those attacks had forced Israeli civilians to flee and drawn Israeli military resources to the north so that they could not contribute to attacks on Gaza. He acknowledged that the possibility of a regional war still existed, but said that it could be avoided if Israel halted its attacks on Gaza. Thousands of Hezbollah supporters gathered to watch the speech on giant screens in locations throughout Lebanon. The largest site, in Beirut’s southern suburbs, was decorated with Hezbollah and Palestinian flags. Celebratory gunfire rang out when he appeared onscreen, and supporters chanted, “We are here for you, Nasrallah.” Early in the speech, Mr. Nasrallah praised Hamas for carrying out the Oct. 7 attack, which included assaults on large groups of civilians and killed more than 1,400 people in Israel. The Hezbollah leader said that no battle was more justified from a religious, moral or humanitarian perspective than “the battle with these Zionists.” He said that Israeli treatment of the Palestinians had gotten so bad that a “great event” had been required to restore the Palestinian cause as “the No. 1 issue in the world.” In Beirut, Mohamad Sbeti, 40, fired a volley of celebratory gunshots into the air with a pistol after Mr. Nasrallah finished speaking. He said he would answer any call by Hezbollah to fight Israel. “We don’t want war,” he said. “But if war comes, me, my two boys and my wife will go and fight.” A driver who had grown poorer during Lebanon’s deep economic crisis in recent years, Mr. Sbeti was not overly worried about the vast damage that Israel could do to Lebanon in a new war. “Why should I be afraid?” he said. “We have nothing to lose.”",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,13,1079,0.461,0.251,0.291,0.5,0.5,0.275,0.264,0.428,0.236,0.5,0.5
204,45233,Mark Landler,The New York Times,"As Gaza War Enters New Phase, Israel Faces Pressure Over Civilian Deaths","Fears are rising that the conflict could spread to the occupied West Bank, where tensions are soaring among Palestinians angered over deadly Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. Nearly a week after Israeli tanks and troops poured into Gaza, Israeli military officials say they have made steady gains against Hamas. But the ground operation, which now encircles Gaza City, is entering an acutely perilous phase, with Israeli troops advancing in an urban landscape that is honeycombed with tunnels and home to many Palestinians. Israeli airstrikes this week on a densely populated neighborhood in northern Gaza that have killed scores of civilians are fueling fears that the war could spread to a second front: the much larger occupied West Bank, where Palestinians have been enraged by the bombardment, which has killed thousands. Harrowing images of the dead and wounded are also intensifying international pressure on Israel. On Friday, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken pressed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to order “humanitarian pauses” in the operation to allow more aid to reach civilians and more people to leave the strip. But Mr. Netanyahu later appeared to reject the idea of pausing the military campaign, saying that any cease-fire would depend on the freeing of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. One senior Israeli military official said he was confident that the troops would seize control of Gaza, and Israel claims to have killed hundreds of Hamas militants in its assaults. But the official was not sure, with global public opinion turning sharply against Israel, that they would have enough time to root out all of the Hamas forces — a push that Israeli leaders have said could take months. Publicly, Israeli commanders are claiming steady gains, but offering few details, about their military response to the Hamas attacks of Oct. 7, which left 1,400 soldiers and civilians dead, including women, children and older people and which included torture and abuse. “Our forces are at the heart of a ground operation in the north of the Gaza Strip,” Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, the Israeli military chief of staff, said in a statement on Thursday. “We’re encircling Gaza City.”",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12,355,0.149,0.114,0.34,0.436,0.5,0.414,0.138,0.5,0.126,0.5,0.5
205,45233,Isaac Herzog,The New York Times,The President of Israel: This Is Not a Battle Just Between Israel and Hamas,"I write these lines from Jerusalem, after spending time with the families of some of the 240 people kidnapped by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7. The hostages now held in Gaza include Jewish Israelis, Muslim Israelis and foreign citizens of different ethnicities. In all my years of public life, the meetings with these families were the most difficult and fraught I’ve ever held. I’ve also spoken with families of some of the more than 1,400 of my people who were killed that day, many of them murdered in their living rooms and kitchens or dancing at a music festival. When I returned from one kibbutz devastated in the attack, I had to wash the blood off my shoes. Tragedy is part of Israeli life, and I knew it would be part of my time as president. But none of us imagined a tragedy like this. Against our will, we in Israel find ourselves at a tipping point for the Middle East and for the world and at the center of what is nothing less than an existential struggle. This is not a battle between Jews and Muslims. And it is not just between Israel and Hamas. It is between those who adhere to norms of humanity and those practicing a barbarism that has no place in the modern world. Just like ISIS and Al Qaeda, the Hamas terrorists who attacked Israeli homes and families had no qualms about burning babies. They tortured children, raped women and destroyed peace-loving communities. They were so proud of their deeds that they made sure to capture them on video and even broadcast them live. These videos will forever remain a stain on those Palestinians and their supporters who celebrated that day and a testament to the depravity of the terrorists and of the ideas that inspired them. But almost as disturbing for me is the realization that many in the world, including in the West, are willing to rationalize these actions or even support them outright. In the capitals of Europe we’ve seen rallies supporting the total destruction of Israel “from the river to the sea.” Professors and students at American colleges make speeches and sign statements justifying terrorism, even glorifying it. We’ve heard certain governments fail to denounce Hamas, instead condemning Israel’s response and even seeking to offer justification for Hamas’s atrocities. It would have been unthinkable to hear such moral confusion uttered after the Sept. 11 attacks or after bombings in London, Barcelona and Baghdad. When I spoke to a joint meeting of Congress this year, I said terrorism “contradicts humanity’s most basic principles of peace.” It turns out that not everyone agrees. All of this shows that this collision of values is happening not just here in Israel but everywhere and that the terrorist ideology threatens all decent people, not only Jews. History has taught us that foul ideologies often find the Jewish people first — but tend not to stop there. We find ourselves on the front lines of this battle, but all nations face this threat, and they must understand that they could be next. Since Hamas forced this war on us, our military has been acting to permanently eliminate this unbearable threat and to enable the return of our hostages. This means fighting in the battlefield that Hamas has created in Gaza over many years — one in which terrorists hide behind and within the civilian population. This is a battlefield with terrorist tunnels under civilian streets, one in which civilian casualties are not avoided at all costs but rather encouraged by Hamas in order to draw global sympathy and blunt Israel’s response. Not only does Hamas store rockets under schools and homes; our intelligence and the confessions of captured terrorists show that the Hamas command center is hidden under Gaza’s central hospital. The result of these sickening tactics is the civilian suffering we are all watching unfold. Many reports of the humanitarian difficulties in parts of Gaza are unverifiable, but there is real suffering, and it concerns us, too. These are our neighbors, and our full withdrawal from Gaza in 2005 was meant to give them free lives and open the door for peace. To our dismay, Hamas and its many Palestinian supporters chose otherwise. Even as Hamas fires hundreds of rockets at our cities and as our soldiers fall in battle, we’re making an effort to give early warning to civilians with leaflets and phone calls, to move them out of the main battle zones and to enable humanitarian aid through Gaza’s border with Egypt. Hundreds of aid trucks are now arriving, with more expected each day. But anyone who thinks the cynical exploitation of civilian suffering will tie our hands and save Hamas this time is wrong. For us and for the Palestinians, the suffering will end only with the removal of Hamas. Anyone trying to tie our hands is, intentionally or not, undermining not only Israel’s defense but also any hope for a world where these atrocities cannot happen. In the months and years before the Hamas massacre, we began to see signs of the emergence of a better Middle East, from the Persian Gulf to North Africa — one inspired by progress and partnership, one in which Israel could finally feel at home among our neighbors. Will this be the world that emerges from this crisis? Or will it be the world desired by the murderous fundamentalists of Hamas? These questions will be key among the strategic issues on the agenda in our discussions with Secretary of State Antony Blinken during his visit to the region beginning Friday — as they were during the visit to Israel of President Biden a few weeks ago. Much is at stake at this moment, not just the future of Israel. On Oct. 7 we were all jolted awake and presented with a shocking challenge to our hopes and morals. How we meet this challenge will shape our future.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,14,992,0.431,0.21,0.522,0.5,0.5,0.173,0.079,0.095,0.176,0.5,0.5
206,45233,Aaron Boxerman,The New York Times,The U.N. says it needs four times as much money for aid efforts for Palestinians.,"The United Nations said on Friday that it needed $1.2 billion to fund humanitarian efforts for Palestinians through the end of the year — more than four times what it asked for just weeks ago — as conditions for civilians worsen rapidly in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. After nearly a month of intense Israeli bombardment that has displaced more than a million people and destroyed large areas of housing in Gaza, “the situation has grown increasingly desperate,” said Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the U.N. humanitarian office. The $1.2 billion appeal announced on Friday is for 2.7 million Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. The United Nations had received only a quarter of the $294 million that it requested in mid-October, Mr. Laerke said, with the biggest external contributions coming from the United States ($24.5 million) and Japan ($7 million). More than 370 trucks carrying humanitarian aid and relief supplies have crossed into Gaza through the Rafah gate on the Egyptian border since Oct. 21, amid mounting pressure on Israel from the United States and other allies to increase the flow of food, water, medicine and other essential items to Gaza civilians. But U.N. officials now say that hundreds of trucks are needed daily to meet the needs of Gaza’s population. To enable a scaling-up of aid flows to Gaza, U.N. officials have also called for the reopening of border crossings from Israel into Gaza, including at Kerem Shalom. Some U.N. officials and diplomats have blamed Israeli security checks for the delays, but Col. Elad Goren, a senior Israeli military officer, said in an interview that Israeli officials were ready to facilitate inspections of many more truckloads at Nitzana, a border post about 25 miles from Rafah. “Israel will not be the bottleneck,” Colonel Goren said, adding that the issue was “the capacity of international organizations to absorb the aid via Rafah.” The colonel serves in COGAT, Israel’s agency overseeing policy for the Palestinian territories. Israel, which, along with Egypt, maintains a blockade of Gaza, has denied that there is a humanitarian crisis in the territory and has refused to agree to let fuel shipments in through Rafah, arguing that it could be used by Hamas. But on Thursday, the Israeli military’s chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, indicated that Israeli policy could change. And Colonel Goren said in the interview that COGAT was beginning to discuss ways of distributing fuel to ensure that it does not go to Hamas, if Israeli political leaders approve allowing it into Gaza. Israeli officials would track the fuel “from above, and the United Nations would be required to give us information so that we could see that it reached the places that we authorized,” Colonel Goren said.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15,458,0.357,0.292,0.367,0.5,0.5,0.141,0.546,0.558,0.307,0.5,0.5
207,45232,Isabel Kershner,The New York Times,A Hamas official vows more attacks against Israel.,"Even as Israeli warplanes pounded Gaza last week ahead of a major ground invasion, Ghazi Hamad, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, unabashedly championed the Oct. 7 terror attack Hamas launched from Gaza that prompted those airstrikes. And he promised similar future assaults with the goal of annihilating Israel. The surprise attack of Oct. 7 “was just the first time, and there will be a second, a third, a fourth,” he told a Lebanese television channel in an interview that aired on Oct. 24 and was later put online by a media watchdog organization. “We must teach Israel a lesson, and we will do this again and again,” Mr. Hamad said in the interview, according to clips of the interview published and translated by the Middle East Media Research Institute, or MEMRI, a nonprofit monitoring group founded by an Israeli and an Israeli-American that is based in Washington, D.C. The videos, as they appeared on the group’s website, had been edited for length but the provided translations were accurate. At least 1,400 people, mostly Israeli civilians, were killed in the Hamas assault, according to Israeli officials, making Oct. 7 the deadliest day in Israel’s 75-year history. Assailants abducted more than 240 hostages, among them grandparents and children, including a 9-month-old baby. Since then, more than 9,000 people in Gaza have been killed, according to health officials in the Hamas-run Palestinian enclave, in the Israeli airstrikes and ground operations that the government says are aimed at rooting out Hamas’s infrastructure. Mr. Hamad asserted that his group had not wanted to harm civilians on Oct. 7 but ran into complications on the ground. His comment was at odds with instructions the assailants had received, according to documents they left behind that were gathered by the Israeli military. Many of the assailants also filmed themselves killing civilians and perpetrating atrocities, uploading the images to social media in real time. He said that Palestinians were willing to pay the price. “We are called a nation of martyrs,” he said, “and we are proud to sacrifice martyrs.” He presented the Palestinians as “the victims of the occupation. Period.” When asked by the interviewer if he meant the occupation of Gaza, he replied, “No, I am talking about all the Palestinian lands.” Asked if that meant the annihilation of Israel, he said, “Yes, of course,” adding that Israel’s existence was “illogical.” “Nobody should blame us for the things we do,” he said, adding, “October 7th, October 10th, the millionth of October — everything we do is justified,” repeating the word justified in English for emphasis. In an interview two days later with The Associated Press in Beirut, Mr. Hamad said that Hamas expected more support from its allies in the region, including the Iranian-backed Hezbollah organization in Lebanon.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8,462,0.079,0.271,0.459,0.5,0.5,0.113,0.173,0.147,0.127,0.5,0.5
208,45232,Matthew Mpoke Bigg,The New York Times,Israel rejects the U.N. human rights agency’s concern that Israeli strikes on Jabaliya may constitute war crimes.,"The United Nations human rights agency expressed “serious concerns” on Wednesday that the casualties and destruction caused by Israeli airstrikes this week on Gaza’s Jabaliya neighborhood, near Gaza City, could amount to war crimes. Israel responded on Thursday, saying that it operated under the laws of war. A spokesman for Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lior Haiat, accused Hamas of using Gazans as human shields. He said that “the entire responsibility lies on the terrorists of Hamas.” “No other country in the world is making the same effort as Israel to prevent civilian casualties,” Mr. Haiat said. Emergency workers were picking through the rubble in Jabaliya on Thursday, two days after missile strikes decimated the densely packed neighborhood of apartment blocks and houses. The health ministry in Gaza said that more than 1,000 people had been injured, killed or were missing after strikes on Tuesday and Wednesday. On Thursday, Jabaliya was hit again. The U.N. Human Rights Office said in a post on social media on Wednesday that “we have serious concerns that these are disproportionate attacks that could amount to war crimes.” Israel’s military said that it had killed a commander for Hamas and destroyed tunnels built by the group in its airstrikes on Tuesday.The strikes came in a war set off when Hamas staged an incursion into Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,400 civilians and soldiers. It also took more than 200 people hostage, according to the Israeli government, of which a handful have been released or rescued. The attacks were launched from Gaza, which Hamas controls and where its fighters are embedded among the civilian population. Mr. Haiat, in his comments responding to the U.N. criticism, said that Israel was fighting a terrorist organization that “is worse than ISIS,” referring to the Islamic State. The Islamic State, which ruled territory in Iraq and Syria between 2014 and 2019 and has spawned offshoots elsewhere, sought to pursue global Islamic rule through battle with anyone who opposed their ideology, including other Muslims. Hamas is a Palestinian organization committed solely to the destruction of Israel. Hamas’s fighters, command posts and other infrastructure are scattered among Gaza’s communities, and Israel has contended that it is impossible to strike Hamas without also hurting noncombatants. But some human rights groups have criticized Israel’s airstrikes and siege of the enclave as disproportionate, and there have been growing calls for a humanitarian pause. Israeli forces have launched thousands of strikes in Gaza since Oct. 7 and last Friday began an invasion of the territory to crush the group. Health authorities in Gaza, a territory of around 2.3 million people, say that more than 8,700 people have been killed, including more than 3,600 children. The health ministry does not say how many Hamas personnel or fighters are included in its figures. Israel has also expanded its 16-year blockade of Gaza, cutting off supplies of water, fuel and food to the territory. The U.N. Human Rights Office’s comments on Wednesday were not the first time since Oct. 7 that it has spoken of war crimes in relation to the conflict. Last week, a spokeswoman, Ravina Shamdasani, told a news briefing that indiscriminate attacks by Palestinian armed groups, including rocket attacks on Israel, must stop and that the taking of hostages was a war crime. But she also said that Israel’s call for civilians in Gaza to move from the north to the south of the enclave raised serious concerns about whether they were being forcibly transferred, which is a war crime. And she said that “Israel’s collective punishment of the entire population must immediately cease,” calling that a war crime. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has dismissed accusations that Israel is inflicting collective punishment on the civilian population. The director of the U.N. Human Rights agency’s New York office resigned this week, accusing the United Nations of abandoning its own principles and international law over Gaza, and of failing to stop Israel’s bombardment, which he characterized as “genocide.” A spokeswoman for the agency said that the director, Craig Mokhiber, had expressed a personal view.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,17,678,0.093,0.122,0.134,0.412,0.5,0.113,0.173,0.061,0.091,0.5,0.5
209,45232,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,The Two Things Worrying U.S. Military Officials About Israel and Hamas,"Step back far enough, and you can see exactly what is driving so much geopolitics today: Ukraine is trying to join the West. Israel is trying to join a new Middle East. And Russia and Iran have teamed up to try to block both. Unfortunately, the new G.O.P. House speaker, Mike Johnson, is either too inexperienced or too ideological (or both) to see this (or to care). He is pushing a budget that would help Israel better defend itself but would deprive Ukraine of essential U.S. economic and military assistance to beat back Russia’s onslaught. And he’s conditioned even the $14.3 billion the administration wants to send to Israel on President Biden agreeing to strip the same amount from funds added for the Internal Revenue Service so it could better collect taxes from cheaters. (Attention, Israel lobby: Do not go along with that game. Next time, aid for Israel will be tied to extreme G.O.P. positions on abortion or guns.) Thank goodness Johnson was not the speaker during World War II; he and his myopic members might have pressed to fund the war against the Germans in Europe but not against the Japanese in the Pacific. Or they would have agreed to Lend-Lease assistance for the allies only if President Franklin Roosevelt would eliminate the I.R.S. altogether. More guns, more butter, no taxes and two fronts. If it sounds like an utterly incoherent worldview that would undermine the American global leadership that has shaped a world we’ve thrived in for the past century, it’s because it is. And if it feels as if House G.O.P. leaders are small thinkers in a big time, it’s because they are. They are shameless, shameful and dangerous. Please do our country a favor and audition for Fox News on some other issue. Because this IS a big moment — comparable to 1945 or 1989. If Ukraine is able to escape Russia’s grasp and eventually join NATO and the European Union — with its formidable army, agricultural exports and technology prowess — it would be a giant boost for a Europe whole and free. And if Israel can be maneuvered back to the bargaining table for a two-state solution with the Palestinian Authority — to pave the way for normalization between the Jewish state and Saudi Arabia — it would be a huge boost for a new, more pluralistic Middle East built around Palestinians, other Arabs and Israelis focused on strengthening their people’s resilience for the future and not their resistance to each other and to the West. If these tectonic shifts can happen, the post-post-Cold War world has a far greater chance to handle other global challenges, like climate change, than if these shifts are stymied. But you don’t need to speak Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, Russian or Ukrainian to understand that Iran-backed Hamas launched its war to stymie the Saudi-Israel normalization and prevent Tehran from being isolated, and that Vladimir Putin launched his war to stop Ukraine from expanding a Europe whole and free and prevent Moscow from being isolated. Russia under Putin and Iran under its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have a lot in common, argued the Russia expert Leon Aron, the author of “Riding the Tiger: Vladimir Putin’s Russia and the Uses of War.” “Both leaders have nothing to offer their people other than quasi-religious wars which enable them to stay in power by keeping their countries either at war or primed for war,” he told me. And both leaders are gunning for other countries whose aspirations are the antithesis of Russia’s and Iran’s poisonous core regime identities. “Ukraine proves that there can be a Slavic, Orthodox country, very close to Russia ethnically — yet free, democratic and thriving, with a Western political and economic orientation and not needing a state of war with the West or to be a police state like Belarus or a military dictatorship like Russia,” Aron said. Meanwhile, normalization of relations between the Jewish state and Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, would very likely pave the way for normalization between Israel and the most populous Muslim country in the world, Indonesia, as well as Malaysia and maybe later even Pakistan. It would prove that Jews and Muslims aren’t destined to be forever in conflict and can revive the not always harmonious — but often harmonious — relations their communities enjoyed throughout much of history before the Palestinian conflict. As I said, nothing would have isolated Iran more. And Hamas knew that if Israel was able to normalize with Saudi Arabia on terms that would satisfy the more moderate Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and bring it significant financial advantages and more legitimacy, the Hamas Gaza resistance-forever model would have been totally isolated. So Hamas launched this war knowing it would bring death and ruin not only to many Israelis but also to many more of its own innocent civilians. Disgusting. Iran knew the same. All of this has created a huge opportunity for Putin. He welcomed a Hamas delegation to Moscow last week, and he has an expanding relationship with Iran underway; Iran is supplying Putin with drones and missiles to kill Ukrainians, in return for cybertechnologies, advanced aircraft and possibly antiaircraft equipment for Tehran. It’s a win-win-win for Putin. By helping Iran fuel the flames of a war between Israel and Iran’s Middle East proxies, Putin knows he is forcing the U.S. to send more spare parts, Patriot missiles and 155-millimeter artillery shells to Israel instead of to Ukraine. And if that flow of arms to Kyiv is then cut off by Johnson and the House G.O.P., all Putin needs to do is count the days until Donald Trump is re-elected and Ukraine is his — or so he probably assumes. Plus all the instability drives up oil prices! While Republicans play dangerous games with military and economic aid, here are the two things that U.S. military officials tell me they are worried about: They believe that the Israelis want to take just Gaza City, where the core of Hamas military and manpower infrastructure is, and then use that as a launching pad for more tactical attacks on Hamas’s leadership and rocket launchers in the rest of Gaza — without occupying it all. But Israel’s military advance is already encountering a common challenge in urban warfare: You get stalled in the alleyways and then call in air power to blow away the enemy and anyone else nearby, leading to significant civilian casualties. The U.S. cannot ignore or defend that strategy for much longer, U.S. officials say. Second, the U.S. still sees a giant hole in the heart of Israel’s strategy: Who will govern Gaza if and when Hamas is evicted? The only likely possibility is the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah, in the West Bank. But the only way those Palestinian leaders will assume that role is if Israel permits their capabilities to grow — provided they get their act together — and if Israel is seen as advancing a two-state solution. But the current government of Benjamin Netanyahu is dedicated to annexing the West Bank. So it looks as if Israel’s army is reoccupying Gaza to eventually turn it over to some kind of legitimate Palestinian Authority — while Israel’s extreme right-wing politicians and settlers are working overtime to delegitimize that authority and drive Palestinians out of the West Bank. This is a strategic contradiction. Israel actually needs a wartime peace process with the Palestinian Authority. The cold hard truth is this: Israel cannot get out of Gaza and sustain Western support without a credible Palestinian partner to govern there, and Ukraine cannot sustain Western support unless it makes substantial gains against Putin’s army this winter or decides that’s impossible and agrees to some kind of dirty deal. That is, some kind of territorial compromise with Putin in return for a NATO security guarantee and a pathway to the European Union. No Western leaders are ready to say that out loud to Kyiv, but they all know it and believe it: Western support for Ukraine cannot and will not be there for an endless war of attrition. That’s why today America must help Israel and Ukraine to blunt the Russia-Iran axis in their theaters. But the morning after their wars, Israel and Ukraine are going to have to face some very hard choices. Because while we may write big checks to both, they will not be blank checks. Each will come with an expiry date and require some very painful political decisions very soon — as they should.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,11,1425,0.214,0.243,0.349,0.31,0.5,0.304,0.372,0.713,0.4,0.5,0.277
210,45231,Aaron Boxerman,The New York Times,Israel Confirms Deaths of 15 Soldiers in Ground Invasion of Gaza,"The soldiers’ deaths were the first publicly confirmed by the Israeli military inside Gaza since an invasion began on Friday. At least 15 Israeli soldiers have been killed in battles in northern Gaza since Tuesday as its forces press deeper into the enclave, attacking dozens of targets affiliated with its Hamas rulers, the Israeli military said. The 15 deaths, mostly of infantry soldiers, were the first casualties inside Gaza publicly confirmed by Israel’s military since it launched a ground invasion on Friday, as fighting appeared to intensify and its forces pushed closer to Gaza City, the biggest city in the territory. The military wing of Hamas said on Telegram on Tuesday that its fighters had ambushed some Israeli soldiers at a building in Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza. Neither side’s account of the fighting could be independently confirmed. In Israel, a small country in which military conscription is a mandatory rite of passage for many Jewish citizens, the soldiers’ names and faces were plastered on the home pages of most news websites. Others were read out live on Israeli television when the military announced their deaths on Wednesday. The Israeli military said it has struck more than 11,000 targets in the Gaza Strip since Oct. 7, when it launched an intense campaign of airstrikes in response to a Hamas attack that killed some 1,400 people in Israel and saw just over 200 people taken hostage. The scale of the bombardment exceeds that of any of its previous wars with Palestinian militants in the 140-square-mile enclave. The toll of the ground invasion is only starting to become clear. On Tuesday, Israeli forces took over what they said was a Hamas military stronghold in western Jabaliya, a densely packed residential area north of Gaza City, claiming to kill more than 50 militants.

211,45231,Farnaz Fassihi,The New York Times,"After Years of Vowing to Destroy Israel, Iran Faces a Dilemma","With Israel bent on crushing Iran’s ally Hamas, Tehran must decide whether it and the proxy militias it arms and trains will live up to its fiery rhetoric. For more than four decades, Iran’s rulers have pledged to destroy Israel. The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, rarely appears in public without wearing a black-and-white checkered Palestinian kaffiyeh. Iranian military commanders gloat over training and arming groups across the region that are enemies of Israel, including Hezbollah and Hamas. And when Hamas conducted the Oct. 7 terror attack on Israel that killed 1,400 people, Iranian officials praised it as a momentous achievement, shattering the Jewish state’s sense of security. Now Iran faces a dilemma, weighing how it and its proxy militias — known as the axis of resistance — should respond to Israel’s invasion of Gaza and whether to bolster its revolutionary credentials at the risk of igniting a broader regional war. More than 8,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. “There is no need for Iran to directly get involved in the war and attack Israel itself because it has the resistance axis militia who follow Iran’s policies and strategies and act on its behalf,” said Nasser Imani, an analyst close to the government, in a telephone interview from Tehran. “Right now Iran is in control mode — it is telling all of them, including Hezbollah, to keep things boiling but have restraint.” For the time being, Iranian officials are publicly signaling they do not want a full-scale war. “I want to reiterate that we are not pursuing the spreading of this war,” Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, said in a recent interview at Iran’s mission to the United Nations. He was in New York to attend U.N. meetings related to the war. But, he added, “The region is at a boiling point and any moment it may explode and this may be unavoidable. If this happens, all sides will lose control.” He warned that regional militias in Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria could open multiple fronts against Israel, with a high potential “that the result will be that things will not go the way that Israel’s regime wants.” He did not elaborate on what would prompt the groups, which he said act independently. Still, Iran does not want regional war, which carries risks for the nation and its religious rulers, according to three Iranians connected to the government who are familiar with internal deliberations and insisted on anonymity to discuss sensitive security matters. The military capabilities of its allies could be significantly diminished by a protracted battle with Israel, and even more so if the U.S. military enters the fray. The Islamic Republic views the militias as its extended arms of influence, able to strike while affordng Tehran a measure of deniability. They give Iran leverage in international negotiations and a means of tilting the balance of power in the Middle East away from archenemies like Israel and the United States, and rivals like Saudi Arabia. But if Iran does nothing, its fiery leaders risk losing credibility among constituents and allies. Some Iranian hard-line conservatives have questioned why Iran’s actions are not matching its rhetoric to “free Al Quds,” or Jerusalem, from Israel’s rule.

212,45228,Vivian Yee,The New York Times,"Israel says Al Shifa hospital conceals underground Hamas command centers, which the group denies.","To people in Gaza, Al Shifa is the biggest and most advanced hospital around — a lifeline, in normal times, and now a place of refuge from relentless Israeli airstrikes. More than 60,000 people are sheltering there. But to the Israeli military, it is a threat, and, perhaps, a target. On Friday, hours before the Israeli military stepped up its bombardment of Gaza in retaliation for Hamas’s mass killings of Israelis three weeks ago, it held a news conference in which it said that Al Shifa conceals underground command centers for Hamas — raising fears that the military was laying the groundwork for attacking the hospital. Hamas “does its command and control in different departments of the hospital,” said Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the chief spokesman for the Israeli military, speaking in English and citing intelligence sources that he did not release. He displayed an illustrated map of the hospital marking what he said were several underground Hamas installations in the complex. “This is where they direct rocket attacks, command Hamas forces,” he said at the news conference held in Tel Aviv. He also played a recording of a call, whose origins he did not specify, in which an unidentified man tells a woman that Hamas’s military headquarters are below the hospital. “God forbid!” the woman, who is also unnamed, replies in the audio recording. Salama Marouf, the head of the Hamas-run Gaza government media office, denied the accusation in a news conference on Friday night, saying Israel had “failed to provide a single piece of evidence” supporting its claims about Al Shifa. He said the recording Adm. Hagari cited was “fabricated.” On Saturday, Adm. Hagari said the news conference about the hospital was part of a continuing effort to “expose” Hamas’s “exploitation of the civilian population in the Gaza Strip.” Also on Saturday, Israel released a pair of videos that it said showed Palestinian prisoners who had been “involved” in Hamas’s Oct. 7 raids on Israel speaking about Hamas’s use of Al Shifa. “I know, for example, according to what I’ve heard, the Shifa Hospital, they’re using it, they’re hiding there,” says one, who describes himself in the video as a paramedic. Israel has long viewed civilian infrastructure such as homes, malls and places of worship as legitimate targets for its strikes, saying Hamas runs operations in those kinds of places, using civilians as human shields. Israel says that when attacking, it attempts to distinguish between civilians and combatants. Gaza’s health ministry has released the names of at least 1,500 children under the age of 10 who it says were killed in Israeli airstrikes from Oct. 7 to Oct. 26.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14,441,0.206,0.593,0.329,0.5,0.5,0.26,0.229,0.354,0.526,0.5,0.5
213,45228,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,The Israeli Officials I Speak With Tell Me They Know Two Things for Sure,"I am watching the Israel-Hamas war and thinking about one of the world leaders I’ve most admired: Manmohan Singh. He was India’s prime minister in late November 2008 when 10 Pakistani jihadist militants from the Lashkar-e-Taiba group, widely believed to be linked to Pakistan’s military intelligence, infiltrated India and killed more than 160 people in Mumbai, including 61 at two luxury hotels. What was Singh’s military response to India’s Sept. 11? He did nothing. Singh never retaliated militarily against the nation of Pakistan or Lashkar camps in Pakistan. It was a remarkable act of restraint. What was the logic? In his book “Choices: Inside the Making of India’s Foreign Policy,” India’s foreign secretary at the time, Shivshankar Menon, explained, making these key points: “I myself pressed at that time for immediate visible retaliation” against the jihadist bases or against Pakistani military intelligence, “which was clearly complicit,” Menon wrote. “To have done so would have been emotionally satisfying and gone some way toward erasing the shame of the incompetence that India’s police and security agencies displayed.”He continued, “But on sober reflection and in hindsight, I now believe that the decision not to retaliate militarily and to concentrate on diplomatic, covert and other means was the right one for that time and place.” Chief among the reasons, Menon said, was that any military response would have quickly obscured just how outrageous and terrible the raid on Indian civilians and tourists was; “the fact of a terrorist attack from Pakistan on India with official involvement on the Pakistan side” would have been lost. Once India retaliated, the world would immediately have had what Menon called a “ho-hum reaction.” Just another Pakistani-Indian dust-up — nothing unusual here. Moreover, Menon wrote, “an Indian attack on Pakistan would have united Pakistan behind the Pakistan Army, which was in increasing domestic disrepute,” and “an attack on Pakistan would also have weakened the civilian government in Pakistan, which had just been elected to power and which sought a much better relationship with India than the Pakistan Army was willing to consider.” He continued, “A war scare, and maybe even a war itself, was exactly what the Pakistan Army wanted to buttress its internal position.” In addition, he wrote, “a war, even a successful war, would have imposed costs and set back the progress of the Indian economy just when the world economy in November 2008 was in an unprecedented financial crisis.” In conclusion, said Menon, “by not attacking Pakistan, India was free to pursue all legal and covert means to achieve its goals of bringing the perpetrators to justice, uniting the international community to force consequences on Pakistan for its behavior and to strengthen the likelihood that such an attack would not take place again.” I understand that Israel is not India — a country of 1.4 billion people, covering a massive territory. The loss of more than 160 people in Mumbai, some of them tourists, was not felt in every home and hamlet, as were Hamas’s killing of roughly 1,400 Israelis, the maiming of countless others and the kidnapping of more than 200 people. Pakistan also has nuclear weapons to deter retaliation. Nevertheless, it is instructive to reflect on the contrast between India’s response to the Mumbai terrorist attack and Israel’s response to the Hamas slaughter. After the initial horror at the sheer barbarism of the Hamas onslaught on Israeli children, older adults and a dance party, what happened? The narrative quickly shifted to the brutality of the Israeli counterattack on Gazan civilians, among whom Hamas has embedded itself. The massive Israeli counterstrike overshadowed Hamas’s terrorism and instead made the organization a hero to some. It has also forced Israel’s new Arab allies in the Abraham Accords to distance themselves from the Jewish state. Meanwhile, with some 360,000 reservists called up, Israel’s economy will almost certainly be depressed if Israel’s ouster of Hamas from Gaza takes months, as predicted. The economy is already expected to shrink more than 10 percent on an annualized basis for the last three months of the year. This after being ranked by The Economist as the fourth-best-performing economy among O.E.C.D. countries in 2022. On a personal level, I am appalled by the reaction of those studnts and progressives who sided with Hamas against Israel — in some cases, even before Israel retaliated — as if the Jewish people were not entitled to either self-determination or self-defense in any part of their ancestral homeland. This backlash also fails to take into account that Israel, for all its faults, is a multicultural society where almost half of graduating doctors today are Arabs or Druze. Or that Hamas is a militant, Islamist organization that does not tolerate dissent or L.G.B.T.Q. individuals and has been dedicated to wiping the Jewish state off the face of the earth. So I have sympathy for the terrible choices that Israel’s government faced after the worst slaughter of Jews since the Holocaust. But it was precisely because I closely followed Singh’s unique reaction to the Mumbai terrorist attack that I immediately advocated a much more targeted, fully thought-through response by Israel. It should have called this Operation Save Our Hostages and focused on capturing and killing the kidnappers of children and grandparents. Every parent could understand that. Instead, Benjamin Netanyahu’s government immediately raced into a plan to, as Defense Minister Yoav Gallant put it, “wipe out” Hamas “from the face of the earth.” And in three weeks Israel has inflicted easily more than triple the number of civilian casualties and caused far more destruction in Gaza than Israel suffered, while committing itself to taking military control of Gaza — an operation, on a relative population basis, that is roughly equivalent to the United States deciding almost overnight to occupy half of Mexico. The Israeli plan, according to Netanyahu, will be a “long and difficult” battle to “destroy the military and governmental capabilities of Hamas and bring the hostages home.” As I said, Israel is not India, and there is no way that it could be expected to turn the other cheek — not in that neighborhood. But what is Netanyahu’s plan? The Israeli officials I speak with tell me they know two things for sure: Hamas will never again govern Gaza, and Israel will not govern a post-Hamas Gaza. They suggest that they will set up an arrangement similarly seen in parts of the West Bank today, with Palestinians in Gaza administering day-to-day life and Israeli military and Shin Bet security teams providing the muscle behind the scenes. This is a half-baked plan. Who are these Palestinians who will be enlisted to govern Gaza on Israel’s behalf? What happens the morning after a Palestinian working for Israel in Gaza is found murdered in an alley with a note pinned to his chest: “Traitor,’’ signed “the Hamas underground.” Moreover, who is going to pay for Israel’s control of, health care for and education of Gaza’s 2.2 million people? Please raise your hand if you think the European Union, the Gulf Arab states or the substantial progressive caucus in the Democratic Party in the U.S. House of Representatives will fund an indefinite Israeli oversight of Gaza — while Netanyahu and his band of Jewish supremacists are pledged to annex the West Bank without equal rights for the Palestinians there. The cost of occupying Gaza could overstretch the Israeli military and economy for years to come. On top of it all, how is Israel going to manage such a complex operation when there is — for good reason — scant trust in Netanyahu? Just on Saturday he pointed to the heads of Israeli military intelligence and Shin Bet as responsible for missing the Hamas surprise attack while excusing himself of any blame. A day later, an outraged Israeli public forced the prime minister to retract his wartime recriminations against his colleagues. But the damage was done. Netanyahu does not have a team of rivals supporting him. He has a team of people being asked to make excruciating long-term choices while knowing their prime minister is a person of such low character that he will blame them for everything that goes wrong and hog all credit for anything that goes right. In sum, dear reader, I understand why Israel believes it needs to destroy Hamas and thereby deter others in the neighborhood from ever contemplating such a thing. But the view from Washington is that Israel’s leadership does not have a viable plan to win or a leader who can navigate the stresses and complexity of this crisis. Israel needs to know that the tolerance of its American ally for massive civilian casualties in Gaza in an open-ended military operation is not unlimited. In fact, we may soon be approaching the limit. Israel should keep the door open for a humanitarian cease-fire and prisoner exchange that will also allow Israel to pause and reflect on exactly where it is going with its rushed Gaza military operation — and the price it could pay over the long haul. That is why I raise the Indian example. Because targeted use of force with limited, achievable goals may serve Israel’s long-term security and prosperity more than an open-ended war to eradicate Hamas. I hope Israel is stress-testing the costs and benefits of both approaches. A pause could also allow the people of Gaza to take stock of what Hamas’s attack on Israel — and Israel’s totally predictable response — has done to their lives, families, homes and businesses. What exactly did Hamas think it would accomplish with this war for the people of Gaza, thousands of whom were traveling to work in Israel every day or exporting agricultural products and other goods across the Gaza-Israel border just a few weeks ago? Hamas has gotten way too much understanding and not enough hard questions. I want to see Hamas’s leaders come out from their tunnels under hospitals and look their people, and the world’s media, in the eye and tell everyone why they thought it was such a great idea to mutilate and kidnap Israeli children and grandmothers and trigger this terrible blowback on the children and grandmothers of their Gaza neighbors — not to mention their own. I have always believed that you can reduce the Israeli-Palestinian conflict since the early 1900s to one line: conflict, timeout, conflict, timeout, conflict, timeout, conflict, timeout, conflict and timeout. The most important difference between the parties is what they each did during the timeouts. Israel built an impressive society and economy, even if flawed, and Hamas took nearly all of its resources and built attack tunnels. Please, Israel, don’t get lost in those tunnels.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,14,1774,0.553,0.615,0.5,0.144,0.5,0.281,0.493,0.105,0.102,0.5,0.5
214,45227,Patrick Kingsley,The New York Times,"Israeli troops press into Gaza, but officials avoid calling it an invasion.","The Israeli military appears to have begun an invasion of Gaza, one that is shrouded in secrecy and ambiguity, with troops advancing into the northern part of the enclave on Friday evening accompanied by a massive aerial and artillery bombardment and remaining there on Saturday evening. The military has not publicly described the operation as an invasion, and the maneuver appears, so far, more limited than some experts had predicted. The military has released only brief footage of its advance, and few Palestinian accounts and no independent footage of the operation have emerged. Gazan internet connections and phone lines — all controlled by Israel, according to the U.S. government — went down. Hamas’s armed wing confirmed on Friday night and Saturday afternoon that its forces were fighting with Israeli soldiers inside Gaza. The Israeli advance appears to be its longest and most ambitious ground operation since Hamas, the militia that controls Gaza, raided southern Israel three weeks ago, killing roughly 1,400 people. Three military officers, all of whom spoke anonymously to discuss a sensitive matter, said that a significant Israeli force had entered northern Gaza after 6 p.m. on Friday with tanks, armored vehicles, infantry and military engineers. The officers said the invasion force fought through the night with Palestinian armed groups, gradually extending their advance into Saturday. Asked for comment on Saturday evening, an Israeli military spokesman, Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, confirmed the force was still inside Gaza. During an earlier war in 2021, the Israeli military told foreign reporters it had invaded Gaza, before retracting the claim as it became clear that soldiers had never left Israel. This time, the military has taken a different approach — declining to confirm the presence of Israeli troops inside Gaza until nearly midnight on Friday night, and then releasing few details about its operation. The secrecy surrounding the operation allows Israel to deflect attention from its military activity, delaying potential scrutiny from critics and retaliation from enemies including Iran and Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militia that dominates southern Lebanon and is allied to Hamas. It may also leave Israeli leaders some flexibility as negotiations over the fate of more than 200 hostages held by Hamas continue. During the first days of Ukraine’s counteroffensive against Russia this year, Ukrainian officials also did not formally announce what their army was doing. Israel’s intensive bombing of Gaza since Oct. 7 has killed more than 7,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Gazan health ministry, prompting outrage and criticism around the world. Within the Israeli government, there are fears that a full-scale invasion might provoke an even stronger regional reaction, encouraging Hezbollah to attack Israel.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12,438,0.286,0.207,0.335,0.5,0.5,0.358,0.176,0.356,0.339,0.5,0.5
215,45227,Gaya Gupta,The New York Times,Pro-Palestinian protests fill the streets in cities around the world.,"Hours after Israeli forces entered Gaza on Friday night, pro-Palestinian protesters poured into the streets of several cities around the world, denouncing the strikes. Since the Hamas attacks against Israel on Oct. 7, anger over the war has erupted in cities across the United States, Europe and the Arab world. Last week, crowds in Jordan and Turkey gathered at the Israeli Embassies while protesters in Lebanon rallied near the French and U.S. Embassies after a deadly blast at a hospital in Gaza had Israel and Hamas pointing fingers at each other. In Istanbul, huge crowds waved Turkish and Palestinian flags at a rally at the Ataturk Airport on Saturday, one day before Turkey’s centennial. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke at the rally, with a scarf bearing the Palestinian and Turkish flags draped around his shoulders. He condemned Israel’s strikes on Gaza, according to videos posted on social media by his Justice and Development Party. “Hamas is not a terror organization,” Mr. Erdogan said, instead calling it “an organization of liberation.” Before the rally, Mr. Erdogan issued a call on social media for everyone in the country to gather in a show of solidarity with the Palestinian people. In New York, hundreds of protesters, some wearing Palestinian flags or kaffiyeh scarves, gathered on Saturday outside the Brooklyn Museum before marching past the Barclays Center to condemn Israel’s attacks on Gaza. Hany Barakat, 34, who was draped in a Palestinian flag, said he had relatives in Gaza, some of whom had been killed during recent Israeli airstrikes. “I’m here to tell the world what happened in Gaza is a crime,” said Mr. Barakat, who is Egyptian. “It has to stop.” The day before, hundreds filled New York’s Grand Central Terminal to call for a cease-fire, and 335 people were taken into custody and issued summonses for criminal trespass and disorderly conduct, according to the police. The rally, organized by the activist group Jewish Voice for Peace, was one of the largest protests in the city since the conflict began. In London, crowds marched Saturday over the Westminster Bridge and gathered throughout central London. Protesters numbered in the tens of thousands, according to the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, an organizer of the event. Last week, an estimated 100,000 people participated in a pro-Palestinian rally in London. The city’s Metropolitan Police, which had deployed more than 1,000 officers in anticipation of the rally, said that one person was arrested after a police officer was assaulted during the demonstration. The police had also restricted people from gathering outside the Israeli Embassy, near Kensington Palace Gardens. In Rome on Saturday, crowds marched in front of the Colosseum, with some people holding Palestinian flags, according to live feeds from The Associated Press.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10,454,0.117,0.283,0.429,0.5,0.5,0.238,0.181,0.554,0.291,0.5,0.5
216,45227,Adam Goldman,The New York Times,Gaza’s Tunnels Loom Large for Israel’s Ground Forces,"Hamas is believed to hide weapons, fighters and even command centers in miles of subterranean pathways and chambers. Just after midnight on Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces announced that they had struck a tunnel that allowed Hamas to “infiltrate Israel through the sea.” The sea tunnel was unusual, a sign that Hamas has designed deadly new ways to attack Israel. The armed group has miles of tunnels under the Gaza Strip — a U.S. official likened them to “miniature cities” — but the exit to this one was on a beach. Among the possible reasons Israel delayed sending troops into Gaza after the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, one stands out, military experts say: the tunnels. Underneath the tiny coastal strip and its more than 2 million people is a vast network of subterranean pathways, rooms, cells and even roads for vehicles. Hamas, which oversees Gaza, is believed to hide weapons, fighters and even command centers in the warren of underground chambers. Overnight on Saturday, Israeli fighter planes struck 150 underground targets in the northern Gaza Strip, the Israeli military said. For the Israeli forces who take part in any large-scale ground invasion, one of the most daunting challenges will be the tunnels, which Hamas has spent years refining. For the people who live above the tunnels, one of the most frightening propositions will be how to survive the subterranean warfare. “We should have no illusions about how this is going to be,” said Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the former leader of United States Central Command, which is responsible for the Middle East. “It will be bloody, brutal fighting.”...Tunnels have been a part of life in Gaza for years, but they sharply multiplied after 2007, when Hamas took control of the enclave and Israel tightened its blockade. Palestinians responded by building hundreds of tunnels to smuggle in food, goods, people and weapons. The tunnels cost Hamas about $3 million each, according to the Israeli military. Some are made with prefabricated concrete and iron, and have medical rooms for providing aid to wounded fighters. Others have spaces 130 feet below ground where people can hide for months. In Israel, people often refer to the tunnel system as “lower Gaza” or the “metro.” Yocheved Lifshitz, an 85-year-old woman who was held hostage by Hamas for 17 days this month, described being marched for miles through a “spider web” of tunnels. She told reporters on Tuesday that Hamas militants led her through the wet and humid underground corridors to “a big hall where some 25 kidnapped were concentrated.”...“Hamas is continuously innovating in the realm of subterranean warfare and exploiting its knowledge and know-how in new, novel ways,” Ms. Richemond-Barak said.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8,447,0.374,0.151,0.398,0.5,0.5,0.149,0.105,0.5,0.254,0.5,0.5
217,45227,Ross Douthat,The New York Times,The Victory Hamas Has Already Won,"In 2014, a new state was formed in the heart of the Middle East. It had a capital, a government, an army and almost 12 million subjects — a larger population than Jordan or Israel. It also had a commitment to butchery, savagery and fanatical violence that quickly earned it the enmity of the entire civilized world. That universal enmity made it hard to imagine how this state of many names — the Islamic State, ISIS, Daesh — could long survive. At the time I offered a speculative analogy to the Bolsheviks in Russia, another ruthless bunch of revolutionary terrorists who faced general opprobrium and foreign interventions, but survived to govern Russia for several generations. But in the event the more plausible scenario unfolded. By refusing even a sheen of moderation, by shocking the conscience of the world while seeking direct confrontation with Western power, the Islamic State enjoyed a temporary recruitment boom followed by a crushing extirpation. Even a weakened American empire in a more multipolar world was able to draw a circle around its barbarism and drive it back into statelessness by force of arms. That antecedent hangs over the current crisis in Israel and Palestine. The atrocities perpetrated by Hamas against innocent Israelis, the snuff films, mutilations and delight in simple cruelty, inspired immediate analogies to the Islamic State’s depredations. They also raised a question about Hamas’s strategy. Was this, as some averred, a desperate but calculated leap to barbarism, undertaken on the theory that only true grisliness would yield the kind of Israeli reaction required to scuttle peacemaking between Israel and its Arab neighbors? Or alternately, was it proof that Hamas had no normal strategic plan at all? Maybe in matching the Islamic State’s cruelties it also matched that regime’s self-destructive folly. Maybe, as The Atlantic’s Yair Rosenberg wrote, the massacres were “rooted not in strategy, but in sadism.” I do not think we have to fully choose between these alternatives. Radical movements are often multivalent, with ideologically motivated sadists and strategically minded gamblers converging on the same plan despite somewhat different self-understandings. But there is another way of thinking about extreme violence as a strategy, one with wider implications than just its potential effects on Israeli policy and Saudi-Israeli rapprochement. Yes, a movement deliberately going to extremes risks the Islamic State scenario, where you isolate yourself so completely that you end up first morally delegitimized and then cornered and destroyed. Clearly that’s the risk Hamas is running now. It didn’t just hold power in Gaza, it enjoyed a certain kind of legitimacy, a degree of favor with parts of the Western left and the Arab world that the Islamic State never enjoyed or ever sought. And in embracing barbaric violence it showed itself willing to light that legitimacy on fire. But suppose that you light the match, you cross the line, you leave the civilized world behind, and a lot of your allies just … stay with you? Suppose you turn southern Israel into an abattoir and you don’t end up like the Islamic State thereafter? Suppose that, instead, most of your sympathizers just go to their usual corners, some making excuses and downplaying the violence, others committing fully to the glory of your cause? Well, then, as Damir Marusic writes in a troubling essay this week, you have achieved a “revolutionary legitimacy” that you didn’t have before. You have embraced a radical immoralism and forced your supporters to rewrite their own morality, to excuse or embrace or (as often happens) to first excuse and then embrace. This process, Marusic notes, effectively “asphyxiates any political program that is less extreme than the revolutionary agenda.” And it closes off exits for your allies in the future: Having followed you this far into darkness, each further step becomes more natural, each step backward more difficult to take. Has Hamas achieved this generally? No: Within much of the Western political establishment they have clearly lost what modest legitimacy they previously enjoyed, horrifying European leaders as well as the more pro-Israel American center-left, and leaving themselves geopolitically exposed as Israel moves to dismantle them. But not as exposed as the Islamic State, not even close. Hamas and its terrorists have held or expanded their popular support across the Muslim world, they have brought powerful figures like Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan rushing to their defense, they have turned out protesters and inspired a surge of antisemitism in Western cities, and they have retained various forms of sympathy within the activist-academic complex. All this has to count as a provisional victory. Perhaps a win that will be swallowed up by Hamas’s military and political destruction, perhaps a coup not worth the cost. But you can see, for now, the shape of a dark strategic triumph that only extreme violence could obtain.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6,800,0.723,0.359,0.439,0.5,0.5,0.147,0.324,0.5,0.522,0.5,0.5
218,45227,Benzion Sanders,The New York Times,I Fought for the I.D.F. in Gaza. It Made Me Fight for Peace.,"When my Israeli infantry unit arrived at the first village in Gaza, in July 2014, we cleared houses by sending grenades through windows, blowing doors open and firing bullets into rooms to avoid ambush and booby traps. We were told Palestinian civilians had fled. I realized this wasn’t true as I stood over the corpse of an elderly Palestinian woman whose face had been mutilated by shrapnel. She had been lying on the sand floor of a shack, in a pool of blood. That was my experience the last time Israeli troops entered the Gaza Strip in a large-scale way, when my special forces unit, attached to the 993rd Nahal Brigade, was one of the first to go in. Like the invasion that the Israeli military has said is imminent, that campaign was precipitated by atrocities carried out by Hamas terrorists. On June 12 of that year, Hamas kidnapped and murdered three Israeli teenagers; soon after, Israelis murdered a Palestinian teenager. The horrific exchange escalated into a larger conflict; ultimately some 70 Israelis and 2,250 Palestinians were killed over seven weeks. Then, as now, Israelis were told that we were going in to deal a decisive blow to Hamas. As Israeli troops made incursions into Gaza on Friday and prepared for possible street-by-street urban combat, complicated by the presence of more than 200 hostages still being held by Hamas, I know firsthand the terror they can expect in an landscape of ??postapocalyptic bombed-out neighborhoods, where Hamas fighters could be lying in wait. There’s also the constant fear of coming under attack by mortars and missiles, and the possibility of a gunman emerging from the group’s underground network of tunnels. Those three fateful weeks inside the Gaza Strip transformed me from a deeply religious, Modern Orthodox yeshiva student and West Bank settler into an activist with the movement opposing the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories, first with the antiwar veterans organization Breaking the Silence and now with Extend, a group that connects Palestinian and Israeli human rights leaders with American Jewish audiences. All our casualties and the suffering brought on Palestinians in Gaza accomplished nothing since our leaders refused to work on creating a political reality in which more violence would not be inevitable. While I believe in self-defense, fighting in Gaza taught me that if my government doesn’t change its approach from crushing Palestinian hope to committing to Palestinian independence, not only will this war kill an untold number of Israelis and Palestinians in addition to the thousands who already have died, but it also will not decisively end terror. A ground invasion is doomed to failure. Even today, I remember how the ground shook from the constant explosions as we moved into Gaza at dusk at the start of the ground invasion on July 17. As we marched into the village of Umm al-Nasr, our Merkava tanks plowed through the fields next to us, and the aerial and artillery bombardments created relentless thunder and lightning — what we jokingly called the sound-and-light show. Our main task over the two weeks I was in the northern Gaza Strip was to clear and secure a perimeter in urban areas to enable combat engineers to identify and demolish tunnels leading into Israel. We never wanted to stay stationary and become easy targets, so we would take up positions in a new house every night. Each house had to be cleared; in one, I found a Kalashnikov rifle with a combat vest and an explosive device. At one point, I listened in terror to graphic reports from our radioman of soldiers from my unit searching for body parts after a missile struck a nearby house they had taken over, injuring and killing some of my comrades. The battle was unpredictable as we faced an enemy that used the complicated terrain to its advantage. It seemed that the Hamas fighters, like most of the civilians, had fled from our advance. Yet on the fourth day of the ground invasion, as we moved toward the Al-Burrah neighborhood in Beit Hanoun, a city in northeast Gaza, Hamas fighters suddenly came out from a tunnel behind us and killed four soldiers at the border fence. As we withdrew from Beit Hanoun, we heard the roar of Air Force fighter jets overhead, followed by deafening explosions and towering plumes of debris and smoke rising from Al-Burrah. I later learned that in those moments, the airstrikes killed eight members of the Wahdan family, mostly women and children, whose home soldiers from my unit had occupied for days while the family was there. At one point, I scribbled some thoughts on a piece of paper. I wrote that some members of my team had been tallying the number of soldiers killed and discussing whether this operation was worth the losses. “I think it could be worth it,” I wrote, “as long as we decisively eliminate the threat.” That’s the lie they told us, and the lie that’s being repeated today: that we can decisively eliminate the threat of Hamas through a military operation. In the years since, Hamas has only grown stronger, despite our sacrifices and despite the death and destruction we had wrought on Gaza. These periodic episodes of killing and destruction, which Israeli commentators and politicians cynically call “mowing the lawn,” have been a price Israel was willing to pay to avoid being pushed toward a two-state solution. We chose to “manage” the conflict through a combination of brute force and economic incentives, instead of working to solve it by ending our perpetual occupation of Palestinian territory. Many of my Palestinian human rights partners who organize nonviolent protests are targeted and harassed by the Israeli military. I believe these policies have the goal of preventing pressure for a Palestinian state and permitting Israeli settlement development and creeping annexation in the West Bank. For years, many of us on the left in Israel have been warning that we will never have peace and security until we find a political agreement in which Palestinians achieve freedom and independence. It isn’t just human rights activists taking this position: Even Ami Ayalon, the former head of the Israeli security service Shin Bet, has argued for years that Palestinian terror can be defeated only by creating Palestinian hope. Tragically, many of those who made this argument were also the victims of Hamas’s heinous attack on Oct. 7. They included a fellow member of my unit who also served with me in Breaking the Silence, an anti-occupation veterans group. He was a security guard at a kibbutz attacked by Hamas and fought the terrorists for seven hours until he ran out of ammunition and was murdered. I left his funeral last week crushed, knowing we had lost such a righteous soul. To me it’s clear. My friend not only fought against Hamas during his final moments to protect his friends and family; he also fought against Hamas during years of activism against the occupation. My heart is broken but I am more resolved than ever to continue his legacy.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,13,1175,0.766,0.164,0.226,0.5,0.5,0.109,0.177,0.126,0.421,0.5,0.5

220,45226,Karen Zraick,The New York Times,A U.N. official offers some of the most dire warnings yet about conditions in Gaza.,"Gaza is “being strangled” by Israel’s extreme siege of the territory, which will soon result in even more civilian deaths, the head of the United Nations agency that aids Palestinians said on Friday, adding that the system to allow aid in from Egypt was “geared to fail.” Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the agency, known as UNRWA, gave perhaps his most dire warning yet of the humanitarian disaster unfolding in the territory, saying that “food, water and fuel — basic commodities — are being used to collectively punish more than two million people, among them, a majority of children and women.” Israel cut off water, food, electricity and fuel to Gaza on Oct. 9, as it began its campaign of airstrikes in response to the Hamas attack on Israel two days earlier, in which 1,400 Israelis were killed. That extreme siege was on top of an existing 16-year blockade by Israel and Egypt that heavily restricts imports and prohibits most people from leaving. Mr. Lazzarini told a news conference in Jerusalem that while the several dozen aid trucks that have entered Gaza over the past week had provided a glimmer of hope, the focus on their numbers was “becoming a distraction.” He stressed that the arrival of aid trucks through one border crossing with Egypt — while the crossings with Israel remain closed — does not equate to a lessening of the siege. “These few trucks are nothing more than crumbs that will not make a difference for two million people,” he said. Ten more aid trucks entered Gaza on Friday morning, bringing the total to 84 over the past week, a spokesman on the Palestinian side of the crossing said. The United Nations has said that at least 100 trucks a day are needed to meet basic needs. Mr. Lazzarini pushed back against suggestions that Hamas could seize aid, insisting that UNRWA had “solid monitoring mechanisms” and “works with vendors and partners that are vetted against the sanctions list.” Hamas is designated as a terrorist organization by the European Union and the United States. “UNRWA does not and will not divert any humanitarian aid into the wrong hands,” he said. The agreement to allow trucks into Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt was the product of intense diplomatic negotiations involving the United States and United Nations. Israel agreed to the deal but has insisted on carrying out lengthy inspections of trucks, saying they are needed to ensure that items such as weapons do not reach Hamas. Israel has also insisted that no fuel be included in the aid convoys, arguing it could be diverted by Hamas. This has spurred protests from Gazans and international aid groups who say fuel is vital to the operation of hospitals, desalination plants and other essential infrastructure, and that supplies are nearly gone. Mr. Lazzarini repeated his call for a humanitarian cease-fire to ensure aid can be safely delivered across Gaza. Israel has carried out a relentless bombing campaign, striking more than 7,000 targets inside Gaza, according to Israeli military figures, more than in any of its past military campaigns there. More than 7,300 people have been killed, including more than 3,000 children, according to figures released by the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza. At least 53 people who worked for UNRWA have been killed, Mr. Lazzarini said. More than a million people have been displaced, and thousands more are injured “with almost no access to hospitals,” which are dependent on fuel-powered generators and at risk of shutting down, Mr. Lazzarini said. Bakeries, life-support machines in hospitals and water treatment plants are all critical, and all need a rapidly dwindling supply of fuel, he warned. He said that the siege was akin to equating all the Palestinians in Gaza with Hamas, which he called “dangerous and misleading.” “It is an equation aimed at dehumanizing people,” he added, “aimed at making the unjustifiable justifiable.”",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,15,651,0.063,0.073,0.07,0.5,0.5,0.087,0.093,0.536,0.094,0.5,0.5
221,45225,Nadav Gavrielov,The New York Times,"Israeli Tanks Raid Gaza Ahead of Invasion, While Aid Trickles In","The United States has advised delaying a ground invasion, in part to get more desperately needed aid, which has flowed slowly, into Gaza. The Israeli military said on Thursday that it had briefly sent tanks into the northern Gaza Strip overnight as part of preparations for the next stage of fighting, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated a ground invasion by the troops massed on the enclave’s border was likely. The military said in a Telegram post that it had hit multiple targets and “operated to prepare the battlefield,” but did not elaborate, while Mr. Netanyahu, in a televised speech on Wednesday evening, vowed that Israel would punish the armed group Hamas for the Oct. 7 assault that massacred more than 1,400 people and seized more than 200 hostages. Since the Hamas attack, Israel has waged an aerial and artillery bombardment that has been far more intensive, more destructive and deadlier than any previously seen in Gaza. The Hamas-controlled government in Gaza said Thursday that the Israeli campaign has killed more than 7,000 people, with nearly 2,000 others trapped in the ruins of destroyed buildings, figures that could not be verified. Hamas’s health ministry on Thursday released a list of 6,747 names of people it said had been confirmed killed, including 2,665 children, along with each person’s ID number, age and sex. It said 281 others who had died in the bombardment could not be identified. That was an apparent response to President Biden, who said on Wednesday that he had “no confidence” in the death toll cited by the Gazan authorities. Last week, Hamas officials put the death toll in an explosion at Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City at 471, while U.S. intelligence agencies assessed that it was 100 to 300...Some prominent Israelis have said that Mr. Netanyahu should resign over the security failures exposed by Hamas. In his speech on Wednesday, he hinted at the issue but stopped short of taking direct responsibility. “This disaster will be fully looked into,” he said. “Everyone will need to give answers — including myself. But all of this will only happen after the war.”",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11,354,0.219,0.341,0.132,0.389,0.5,0.241,0.251,0.5,0.265,0.5,0.5
222,45225,Vivian Yee,The New York Times,"Israeli inspections of trucks slows aid for Gaza, aid and U.N. officials say.","Aid trucks have begun arriving in Gaza, but in such small numbers that aid groups have said help has reached only a tiny segment of the two million people under siege in the strip. From Saturday through Thursday morning, only 74 trucks had entered in total, far short of the 100 a day or more that the United Nations says Gaza desperately needs. Israel and Egypt have reached a deal to allow in water, food and medical supplies, provided Israel can inspect the shipments for weapons or other things it says could be of use to Hamas’s military wing. But that arrangement, brokered by the United States and United Nations, has not produced a sustained flow of aid. Israel has pushed hard in negotiations to control the inspections, which U.N. officials and diplomats say Israeli personnel now perform at a border checkpoint about 25 miles from the crossing where aid trucks move from Egypt into Gaza. By supervising the process, Israel has overridden U.N. arguments that the aid should be monitored by independent U.N. inspectors, as in previous conflicts. Two U.N. aid officials and a European Union official who was briefed on the negotiations said that Israel’s demands to inspect the trucks closely have made larger deliveries difficult or impossible. In an added restriction, Israel has informed the U.N. that it had the capacity and manpower to inspect at most 40 trucks a day, said one of the U.N. aid officials, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the situation. The Israeli inspections are adding time and complications to an already logistically knotty process. At Egypt’s Rafah crossing with Gaza, all of the aid coming in from foreign countries, the United Nations and Egyptian charities is being handled by the Egyptian Red Crescent. One of the U.N. aid officials said the Egyptian Red Crescent’s disorganized approach to loading the trucks had slowed down the deliveries, adding time as Israeli inspectors unloaded and reloaded the trucks box by box. Individual donors are sending generous amounts of aid, the official said, but much of it does not meet humanitarian needs in Gaza, where people do not have clean water or fuel to cook donated food items such as rice. But the inspections are a key bottleneck. After reviewing only inventory paperwork for the first 20 aid trucks, which crossed into Gaza on Saturday, Israel has conducted thorough physical checks of each of the 54 trucks that have entered Gaza since, in one case holding trucks up for more than 24 hours, one of the U.N. aid officials said. Diplomats, U.N. officials, the E.U. official and workers at the Rafah crossing and at another crossing south of Rafah, between Egypt and Israel, described a time-consuming inspection process involving a round-trip journey of about 50 miles. Aid trucks waiting to pass through Rafah must travel about 25 miles south to this second point for inspection, which Israel calls Nitzana and Egypt calls El Ouga. After that, Egypt’s military escorts the trucks back to Rafah to move into Gaza. An Israeli security official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said inspections did somewhat delay delivering the aid, but added that Israel would not compromise on its security needs. The U.N. said fuel is critical in Gaza to keep hospitals operating and to power the desalination plants that provide drinking water, but Israel has resisted allowing in fuel, saying that it could be used by Hamas. It has also been reluctant to permit other types of aid in, such as hygiene packs that include diapers and soap and shelter supplies such as tents and mattresses, European officials working on the issue have said.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,13,607,0.198,0.307,0.424,0.5,0.5,0.505,0.491,0.5,0.347,0.5,0.5

The tensions inflamed by the Israel-Hamas war that have roiled university campuses in the United States spilled into the Cooper Union in New York on Wednesday, with pro-Palestinian protesters pounding on one side of locked library doors and Jewish students on the other. The episode, captured in a six-second video snippet that was widely shared on social media, was among the latest examples of how sharply the Middle East conflict has divided student bodies at a number of top liberal arts colleges. The Cooper Union, which is on the edge of Manhattan’s East Village neighborhood and which grants degrees in art, architecture and engineering, has fewer than 1,000 students. In the video, a small group of students, several identifiable as Jews by their skullcaps, can be seen talking to one another inside the library while students outside bang on the doors and yell pro-Palestinian slogans. The encounter followed a planned protest that began at about 1 p.m. outside the college, according to accounts provided by the police, a Cooper Union spokeswoman and a student who was in the library at the time. About 70 students had been chanting pro-Palestinian slogans while about 20 pro-Israel students stood nearby watching silently in a counterprotest, John Chell, chief of patrol for the Police Department, said at a news conference on Thursday.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11,241,0.291,0.321,0.464,0.5,0.5,0.175,0.291,0.368,0.5,0.5,0.5
224,45224,Euan Ward,The New York Times,"Hezbollah, Hamas and Islamic Jihad leaders met to plot a path to ‘victory.’","Leaders from Hezbollah, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad — the three primary Iran-backed groups currently fighting Israel — met to discuss what the alliance must do to achieve “a real victory for the resistance” amid this “sensitive stage” in the Middle East, Hezbollah said on Wednesday. In a photo of the meeting released by Hezbollah’s news media arm, Hassan Nasrallah, the secretary general of the Lebanese militant group and political party; Saleh Al-Arouri, the deputy head of Hamas; and Ziad Nakhale, the secretary-general of Islamic Jihad, sit beneath framed portraits of Iran’s supreme leaders. Hezbollah did not specify when the meeting took place, but it served as the latest evidence of deepening ties between the three militant groups. The deliberate symbolism in the photo was also readily apparent. Beneath the portraits, a bust of the Dome of the Rock, the Islamic shrine that is a widely recognized symbol of Jerusalem, can be seen adorned with a keffiyeh, a symbol of Palestinian nationalism. A framed image of a Quranic verse is also visible. It reads: “They will not fight you all except within fortified cities or from behind walls.” In recent years, Hezbollah, Hamas and Islamic Jihad have sought to reforge an alliance after a period of colder relations between Hezbollah and Hamas, when the two armed groups backed opposing sides in the Syrian civil war. Although scarce, the details of the meeting released on Wednesday come as tensions have risen on the Israel-Lebanon border and amid fears of a broader conflict that would draw in supporters of Hamas, which Israel aims to eradicate as part of an anticipated ground invasion of the Gaza Strip. If Israel pushes ahead with its stated goal of attempting to dismantle Hamas, analysts believe this may constitute one of Hezbollah’s so-called red lines with Israel.

225,45224,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,Israel: From the Six-Day War to the Six-Front War,"If you care about Israel, you should be more worried than any other time since 1967. Back then, Israel defeated the armies of three Arab states — Egypt, Syria and Jordan — in what became known as the Six-Day War. Today, if you look closely, you’ll see that Israel is now fighting the Six-Front War. This war is being fought by and through nonstate actors, nation-states, social networks, ideological movements, West Bank communities and Israeli political factions, and it is the most complex war that I’ve ever covered. But one thing is crystal clear to me: Israel cannot win this six-front war alone. It can win only if Israel — and the United States — can assemble a global alliance. Unfortunately, Israel today has a prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and a ruling coalition that will not and cannot produce the keystone needed to sustain such a global alliance. That keystone is to declare an end to the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and overhaul Israel’s relations with the Palestinian Authority so that it becomes a credible, legitimate Palestinian partner that can govern a post-Hamas Gaza and forge a broader two-state solution including the West Bank. If Israel is asking its best allies to help the Jewish state seek justice in Gaza while asking them to look the other way as Israel builds a settlement kingdom in the West Bank with the express goal of annexation, that is strategically and morally incoherent. It won’t work. Israel will not be able to generate the time, the financial assistance, the legitimacy, the Palestinian partner or the global allies it needs to win this six-front war. And all six fronts are now hiding in plain sight. First, Israel is fighting a full-scale war against Hamas in and around Gaza, in which, we can now see, Hamas still has so much residual capacity that it was able to launch a seaborne attack on Israel on Tuesday and on Wednesday fired long-range rockets toward Israel’s southern port city of Eilat and northern port city of Haifa. It is terrifying to see how many resources Hamas diverted to build weapons rather than to aid Gaza’s human capital — and how effectively it hid that from Israel and the world. Indeed, it is hard not to notice the contrast between Gaza’s evident human poverty and the wealth of weaponry Hamas has built and deployed. Hamas’s dream has long been the unification of  the fronts surrounding Israel, regionally and globally. Israel’s strategy has always been to act in ways to prevent that — until this Netanyahu coalition of ultra-Orthodox and Jewish supremacists came to power last December and began behaving in ways that actually helped foster the unification of the anti-Israel fronts. How so? The Jewish supremacists in Netanyahu’s cabinet immediately began to challenge the status quo on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, which is revered by Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and where one of Islam’s holiest sites, the Aqsa Mosque, stands. The Netanyahu government began taking steps to impose much harsher conditions on Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza held in Israeli jails. And it laid plans for a huge expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank to prevent a contiguous Palestinian state from ever coming into being there. This is the first Israeli government ever to make annexation of the West Bank a stated objective in its coalition agreement. On top of all of this, the United States appeared to be getting close to forging a deal for Saudi Arabia to normalize diplomatic and commercial relations with Israel — which would have been the crowning achievement of Netanyahu’s effort to prove that Israel could have normal relations with Arab and Muslim states and not have to give one inch to the Palestinians. Which leads to the second front: Israel against Iran and its other proxies. That is, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria, Islamist militias in Syria and Iraq and the Houthi militia in Yemen. All of them in recent days have launched drones and rockets toward Israel or at U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria. I believe that Iran, like Hamas, saw the U.S.-Israel effort to normalize relations between Israel and Arab-Muslim states as a strategic threat that would have left Iran and its proxies isolated in the region. At the same time, I believe Hezbollah came to realize that if Israel obliterated Hamas, as it declared it would, Hezbollah would be next. It would also be much weaker without Hamas draining energy and focus from Israel’s military. Therefore, Hezbollah decided that, at a minimum, it needed to open a low-grade second front against Israel. As a result, Israel has been forced to evacuate some 130,000 civilians from its northern border along with the tens of thousands of Israelis evacuated from the southwestern border with Gaza. This whole displacement puts a huge stress on housing and the Israeli treasury. The third front is the universe of social networks and other digital narratives about who is good and who is evil. When the world gets this interdependent, when — thanks to smartphones and social networks — nothing is hidden and we can hear one another whisper, the dominant narrative has real strategic value. That social media was so easily manipulated by Hamas that the episode of a misfired Palestinian missile hitting a Gaza hospital was initially blamed on Israel is deeply disturbing, because these narratives shape the decisions of governments and politicians and the relationship between chief executives and their employees. Be advised: If Israel does invade Gaza, corporations everywhere will be facing competing demands from employees to denounce Israel or Hamas. The fourth front is the intellectual/philosophical struggle between the international progressive movement and Israel. I believe that some elements of that progressive movement, which I realize is big and diverse, have lost their moral bearings on this issue. For instance, we’ve seen numerous demonstrations on American college campuses that essentially blame Israel for the barbaric Hamas invasion, arguing that Hamas is engaged in a legitimate “anticolonial struggle.” These progressive demonstrators seem to believe that all of Israel is a colonial enterprise — not just the West Bank settlements — and therefore the Jewish people do not have the right either to self-determination or self-defense in their ancestral homeland, whether it’s within post-1967 borders or pre-1967 ones. And for an intellectual community seemingly concerned about nations occupying other nations and denying their right to self-rule, you don’t see a lot of progressive college campus demonstrations against the biggest oppressing power in the Middle East today: Iran. Besides crushing its own women seeking greater freedom of thought and dress, Tehran is effectively controlling four Arab states — Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Iraq — through its proxies. Lebanon, a country I know well, has not been able to elect a new president for a year in large part because Iran refuses to allow the Lebanese to have any president who will not always bend to Tehran’s wishes and interests. Unfortunately, independent Lebanese are powerless to remove Iran’s grip over their Parliament and government, exercised largely through the barrel of Hezbollah guns. Middle East Eye reported that back in 2014 Ali Reza Zakani, a Tehran city representative in the Iranian Parliament, was boasting about how Iran now rules in four Arab capitals: Baghdad, Damascus, Beirut and Sana, Yemen. To reduce this incredibly complex struggle of two peoples for the same land to a colonial war is to commit intellectual fraud. Or as the Israeli writer Yossi Klein Halevi put it in The Times of Israel on Wednesday: “To blame the occupation and its consequences wholly on Israel is to dismiss the history of Israeli peace offers and Palestinian rejection. To label Israel as one more colonialist creation is to distort the unique story of the homecoming of an uprooted people, a majority of whom were refugees from destroyed Jewish communities in the Middle East.” But here’s what’s also intellectually corrupt: buying into the Israeli right-wing settler narrative, now being spread far and wide inside Israel, that Hamas violence is so savage it clearly has nothing to do with anything settlers have done — so more settlements are just fine. My view: This is a territorial dispute between two people claiming the same land which needs to be divided as equitably as possible. Such a compromise is the cornerstone for any success against Hamas. So, if you are for a two-state solution, you are my friend and if you are against a two-state solution, you are not my friend. The fifth front is inside Israel and the occupied territories. In the West Bank, right-wing Jewish settlers are attacking Palestinians, while disrupting the efforts of Israel’s military to keep a lid on it in collaboration with the security forces of the Palestinian Authority, led by Mahmoud Abbas. We must remember that the P.A. has recognized Israel’s right to exist as part of the Oslo accords. It would be terrible if that front explodes into a confrontation between the P.A. and Israel, because then there would be scant hope for ever enlisting the authority’s help in governing Gaza. But there will also be no hope for that if Palestinians in the West Bank and around the world don’t insist on building a more effective, non-corrupt Palestinian Authority. That is long past due — and it is not just Israel’s fault that it has not happened. Palestinians have agency too. The sixth front is inside Israel itself, mostly between its Jewish citizens. That front has been papered over for the moment, but it lurks just beneath the surface. It is the clash driven by Netanyahu’s enduring political strategy at home: divide and rule. He has built his whole political career on pitting factions of Israeli society against one another, eroding the kind of societal unity that is essential to win the war. His government took that strategy to an extreme after it came into office last December and immediately moved to strip the Israeli Supreme Court of its powers to check decisions of the executive and legislative branches. In the process he turned tens of thousands of Israelis out every Saturday to protect their democracy and prompted air force pilots and other elite war-fighters to suspend their reserve duty, saying they would not serve a country heading toward dictatorship. It divided and distracted Israel and its military at exactly the wrong time — not that there was ever a good time. How do you win a six-front war? I repeat: only with a coalition of people and nations who believe in democratic values and the right of self-determination for all people. Until and unless Israel generates a government that can generate that coalition, it will not have the time, the resources, the Palestinian partner and the legitimacy it needs to take down Hamas in Gaza. It will be fighting mostly alongside the United States as its only true and sustainable ally. And a lot of the strength of that alliance today rests on Joe Biden and the fact that he brings to this crisis a set of core, gut principles about America’s role in the world, right versus wrong, democracy versus autocracy. Another president with those instincts may not come along again anytime soon. In other words, Biden has created diplomatic working capital — that comes with a time limit — for both Israelis and the Palestinian Authority. They must both use it wisely.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,9,1906,0.453,0.267,0.746,0.112,0.5,0.409,0.268,0.339,0.388,0.5,0.5

The agency, UNRWA, operates shelters and health care clinics across Gaza, and has been a lifeline for the hundreds of thousands who have been displaced, injured and made homeless by Israeli airstrikes. It has been tasked, in cooperation with other U.N. bodies, with distributing the limited aid supplies that have been allowed into Gaza through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. So far, only a small number of trucks carrying food, water and medicine have entered Gaza. Palestinians and aid workers had expressed hopes that fuel would be included in the convoys, but Israel has ruled that out for the moment, arguing it could fall into the hands of Hamas, which governs the enclave and staged surprise attacks on Israel on Oct. 7. Juliette Touma, the UNRWA spokeswoman, said the agency desperately needed fuel for its vehicles to deliver food, water and medicines from its warehouses to those in need across the enclave. Speaking early in the day, Ms. Touma said that the next 24 hours were going to be critical. If no fuel gets in, “we are going to have to make some very tough decisions,” including whether to use the remaining fuel for aid deliveries, for health care clinics or for shelters, Ms. Touma said in phone interview from Jerusalem. “We are going to have to start choosing where to send the aid, and how often,” she said. Ms. Touma also warned it would have to start rationing fuel in the nearly 150 shelters it operates, where 600,000 displaced Palestinians have sought safety, as well as in health care clinics, which on Tuesday had more than 4,000 patient visits. Since Saturday, four humanitarian convoys — a total of 62 trucks — have reached Gaza through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. UNRWA teams manage the storage and distribution of the contents of these shipments in cooperation with other U.N. bodies. Since Israel started its retaliation campaign, including airstrikes, earlier this month, the agency has turned schools into shelters for displaced people, and all resources have been put toward tending to the sick and injured. In total, 38 UNRWA staff members have been killed, and another 20 have been injured since the beginning of the escalation, according to the agency.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,22,414,0.206,0.371,0.439,0.5,0.5,0.156,0.151,0.5,0.382,0.5,0.5

The Israeli authorities said on Sunday that they would evacuate 14 more Israeli villages near the northern border with Lebanon amid escalating tit-for-tat clashes between Israeli forces and Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese militia, that have raised concerns that the Israel-Hamas war could ignite other regional confrontations. Overall, more than 152,000 Israeli residents of cities, towns and villages near the borders of Gaza in the south and Lebanon in the north have evacuated their homes for safer parts of the country over the past two weeks, according to local Israeli authorities. Haim Bibas, the chairman of the Federation of Local Authorities in Israel, who provided the figure, said it was likely to be the largest internal population displacement in the country’s 75-year history. The scale of the displacement in Israel does not compare with that in Gaza, where an estimated 700,000 Palestinians in the northern half of the crowded coastal territory are believed to have heeded warnings from the Israeli military to move south amid an ongoing aerial bombardment. The United Nations said on Sunday that 1.4 million residents of Gaza were internally displaced overall. The total population of Gaza is more than two million people, while Israel’s population is over nine million. The Israeli military said that over the past 24 hours, it had eliminated several squads of fighters trying to close in on Israeli positions and communities along the border with Lebanon and that Israel had attacked Hezbollah assets, observation points and military compounds across the border, including one from which a ground-to-air missile was fired at an Israeli drone.

230,45220,Gershon Baskin,The New York Times,I Negotiated Israel’s Hardest Hostage Deal. Here’s What’s Next in Gaza.,"Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier, had been a hostage for five years before Israel and Hamas were seriously willing to work toward his release. That was 2011. I had been pursuing secret back-channel communications with Hamas since a week after he was captured in a cross-border raid and dragged into Gaza. My partner in these secret negotiations was Ghazi Hamad, Hamas’s spokesman who was then also a political adviser to its prime minister. Mr. Hamad showed compassion for Mr. Shalit and his family many times. In the end, the price of Mr. Shalit’s freedom was steep: 1,027 Palestinian prisoners. On Oct. 18, 2011, he returned to his home in northern Israel. When I talked to Mr. Hamad on the phone early that morning, he blurted out in a moment of spontaneous joy, “Next time we will negotiate peace!” On the first night of Israel’s bombing, I have learned, Mr. Hamad’s home in Gaza City was destroyed in an airstrike. I saw it as a clear signal from Israel: Everyone affiliated with Hamas is a target. The time for talk is over. Today, there are again hostages in Gaza — more than 200, according to the Israeli government. On Friday, Hamas released two of them — an American mother and daughter — but the fate of the others remains unclear. As deadly airstrikes on Gaza continue and Israel amasses troops at the border in preparation for a ground invasion, their safety grows more precarious each day. Should Israel negotiate to get their civilian hostages out of Gaza as quickly as possible? Should it sacrifice them to achieve its goal going into this war — to eliminate Hamas? Should it exchange them for prisoners, as it has done in the past? These considerations present a stark dilemma for all Israelis but perhaps none more so than Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was once the staunchest opponent of negotiating with terrorists of any kind but who also came to realize that the ethos of leaving no soldier behind did sometimes require that kind of engagement. Israelis have been held hostage many times over the nation’s 75 years. In May 1974, members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine held 115 hostages, most of them high school students in the town of Maalot, in northern Israel, for two days, an episode that ended in the murders of 22 hostages. An Air Force officer, Ron Arad, was shot down over Lebanon in 1986 and was never returned. In May 1985, Israel released 1,150 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the return of three Israeli soldiers captured in Lebanon. Over the course of those painful episodes, the nation learned a great deal about how to work for its hostages’ release, whether through third-party negotiations, secret back channels or force. But today’s hostage crisis is unlike any other. It’s not just a few people being held by hostile forces. It’s about 200 people, including women, children and the elderly, and it’s unfolding in the midst of a full-blown war. None of the old rules apply. Hamas held Mr. Shalit in a secret location. Is that possible with such a large group? Gaza is a very small territory with a very dense population, not all of whom support Hamas. The inevitable intelligence leaks could enable Israel to conduct rescue operations. Israeli intelligence analysts will be looking for leads anywhere they can find them, such as data from cellphones found on the bodies of terrorists killed since the attack on Oct. 7. It is equally unclear how this group of hostages will be treated. Hamas treated Mr. Shalit surprisingly well during his years of captivity. He was never physically tortured. Could the same be the case with so many hostages? Hamas has said that some of them are being held by other groups, including Islamic Jihad. Whatever Hamas’s approach is toward these hostages, there is no guarantee that another group will share it. Killing hostages is not what I would previously have expected from Hamas. But the killing spree of Oct. 7, including the butchering of whole families, the burning of homes, the destruction of whole communities, changed that. On Monday, it released a video of a 21-year-old hostage who appeared to have been wounded and was being treated on camera. There were no signs that she had been tortured but it was clear that she was under duress. Negotiating for the release of hostages may also be less popular this time around. The Shalit deal was very difficult for Israel to accept. More than 300 of the Palestinians who were released from prison had been serving life sentences for violent acts, including killing Israelis. It was hard for me, too: My wife’s first cousin, Sasson Nuriel, was kidnapped and killed by Hamas in September 2005. Four of the people responsible for murdering him were released as part of the agreement that I negotiated. Still, in the end, nearly 80 percent of the public, according to one poll, along with 26 government ministers and the entire national security establishment, supported the deal. Prime Minister Netanyahu signed off on the agreement. Today, Israel holds about 7,000 Palestinian prisoners, of whom 559 are serving life sentences for killing Israelis, according to Addameer, a Palestinian prisoners’ rights group. Will Israelis, still reeling from the atrocities of Oct. 7, be willing to accept this kind of bargain again? Is it safe to do so? One of the men who killed my wife’s cousin, who was released in exchange for Mr. Shalit, was among the leaders of the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks, according to Israel’s report of his recent killing. I have no official authorization as a negotiator, but as far as I know, I’m the only Israeli citizen who has contacts both with the leadership of Hamas and the leadership of Israel, so I have been in continual touch with both sides in hopes of advancing some long-term agreement. The release of those first two hostages is a positive development, but overall, prospects remain dim. Hamas continues to demand an end to “Israel’s aggression against Gaza,” and Israel says it has no intention of ending this war “until the job is done.” Mr. Hamad has not backed down from Hamas’s brutal attacks. In my conversations with Hamas leaders, I have pushed them to release the women, children, elderly and sick as a humanitarian gesture. Hamas rejected the idea. I believe that Israel is open to accepting a small deal in exchange for such a group, so I proposed to my Hamas contacts that they trade them for the 33 Palestinian women and 170 Palestinian minors currently in Israeli prisons, according to Addameer. Hamas rejected that, too. Right now, Hamas’s focus is achieving a comprehensive cease-fire. There are still official talks taking place. Qatar is speaking with Hamas and the United States is speaking with Qatar and Israel. This is too convoluted and complex. There need to be direct talks among Israel, Qatar and Hamas and no one else. Not the United States and not Iran. The agreement of Hamas to release the two Americans was apparently negotiated by the Qataris and assisted by the International Committee of the Red Cross. The United States still has a role to play. It should continue to pressure Qatar, which should give an ultimatum that if hostages are not released within, say, 24 hours, all of Hamas’s leaders will be expelled from Qatar, where many are based. I don’t believe that Qatar will agree to that — and certainly not without an Israeli cease-fire — but the American government and others have leverage over Qatar and it should be used. There is still a small chance and a limited window of opportunity before the ground assault begins to attain the release of some of the hostages through this kind of agreement. After the invasion begins, it will depend on Israeli special forces to try to save them. Some will again see their homes; others may not. At the other end of this war, I hope that the trauma and suffering we are all feeling on both sides of the conflict will spur us to figure out how to share this land that belongs to both Israelis and Palestinians. Maybe our collective suffering and pain can be channeled to focusing on how to live together rather than killing each other. That will be a long process and cannot include the leaders on both sides who have brought us to where we are. We need a new generation of leaders with new vision, new hopes, new dreams and the ability to lead. I hope that many of the hostages, together with their families, will soon be able to join the voices calling for change.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,11,1456,0.423,0.462,0.286,0.479,0.5,0.399,0.448,0.343,0.393,0.5,0.5
231,45219,Liam Stack,The New York Times,"Hamas has released two American-Israeli hostages, a mother and daughter.","Two Americans held captive in Gaza by Hamas, a woman and her teenage daughter, were released on Friday, nearly two weeks after they were taken hostage along with 200 others during terrorist raids in southern Israel that ignited a war, leaving thousands of people dead. Hamas said it was freeing Judith Raanan, 59, and her daughter, Natalie Raanan, 17, for “humanitarian reasons,” but did not elaborate. Their releases came after negotiations involving officials in Qatar, who served as mediators between the United States and Hamas, the Palestinian group that controls the Gaza Strip. The women, dual American-Israeli citizens who live in Illinois, had been kidnapped from Kibbutz Nahal Oz during the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel that killed some 1,400 people, and taken back to the Gaza Strip. They were released to the International Committee of the Red Cross and then handed over to the Israel Defense Forces, who took them to be reunited with family at an Israeli military base, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Hamas still holds 10 other Americans hostage, according to the State Department, and President Biden vowed on Friday to make every effort to reunite their families. “We will not stop until we get their loved ones home,” Mr. Biden said in a statement. “I have no higher priority than the safety of Americans held hostage around the world.” He asked the public to respect the privacy of the Raanans “as they recover and heal.” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a news conference on Friday that “every hostage needs to be released and needs to be released now,” unconditionally. Mr. Blinken said he could not discuss details of the negotiations to free Judith and Natalie Raanan.

232,45219,Monika Pronczuk,The New York Times,"With food and water still blocked from entering Gaza, hospitals are ‘on the brink of collapse,’ the U.N. says.","Hospitals and health care centers in the Gaza Strip are “on the brink of collapse,” the United Nations warned on Friday, with disagreements between Egypt and Israel still blocking aid from entering. Despite a U.N.-led deal that laid out the groundwork for transporting food, water and medicine through the Rafah border crossing, no outside resources have been allowed in for the last 14 days because of disagreements over how often to allow convoys to cross, how to screen them and what they can include. More than 60 percent of primary health care centers were shut down, and hospitals were running out of power, medicines, equipment and staff, the U.N.’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a report. Several hospitals are out of service because they ran out of fuel, the Hamas-operated Gaza health ministry said. According to UNRWA, the U.N. agency that aids Palestinians, it had about 15 days supply of medicines, with one week’s supply of insulin remaining. The Gaza health ministry said on Friday it was “working to continue” medical procedures such as dialysis, C-sections, cancer treatment and vaccinations with “depleted resources.” But the U.N. warned that because hospitals were being overwhelmed by the number of patients, many lying on the floors, these vital procedures might soon be halted. The Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital, the only facility in Gaza providing chemotherapy for more than 9,000 patients, was struggling to remain operational, the U.N. said, relying on a single generator for electricity. Fuel was the biggest concern, aid groups said, with the last liters remaining in the territory being relocated to hospitals to avoid having to shut them down, the U.N. report said. Earlier this week, the World Health Organization, together with UNRWA, delivered 10,600 liters of fuel to the Al- Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, preventing the cessation of medical services, which would be disastrous for the northern part of the territory. The aid group Doctors Without Borders (also known by its French name, Médecins Sans Frontières), said on Friday that the Al-Shifa Hospital, where thousands of people were sheltering, had, “at most,” 24 hours of fuel left. Health care centers also continue to be targeted by airstrikes. The W.H.O. said that it had documented 59 attacks on health care facilities and 23 on ambulances. Four hospitals in northern Gaza had to be evacuated and are no longer functional. “We call on the international community to expedite the entry of medical supplies and fuel to hospitals,” the Gaza health ministry said on Friday. “We call on the international community to stop the ongoing violations against health personnel, institutions and ambulances.” In a statement, Doctors Without Borders said, “We are already witnessing the collapse of patient care,” adding, “In short, without electricity, many patients will die — especially those in intensive care, neonatology and on respiratory support machines.”",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,19,471,0.081,0.12,0.121,0.5,0.5,0.105,0.083,0.184,0.116,0.5,0.5
233,45219,Michelle Goldberg,The New York Times,It Is Impossible to Know What to Believe in This Hideous War,"As a few bleak anecdotes illustrate, it is often impossible, in real time, for outsiders to know what is happening in the ceaselessly reigniting war between Israel and the Palestinians. This was true even before social media and before Elon Musk acquired Twitter and turned it into the cesspool of misinformation, trolling and hysteria now called X. But today countless people are plugged into a frantically churning news cycle, trying to instantly metabolize a conflict that is a hall of mirrors in the best of times and is now careening toward a possible regional war, with all the propaganda and mass panic that entails. It’s an epistemological catastrophe that is putting people’s lives in danger. I went to bed on Tuesday night assuming, as many people did, that an Israeli airstrike had killed at least 500 people in Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza. That’s what the Gaza Health Ministry claimed, and those claims made headlines in leading news outlets, including this one. Politicians issued impassioned condemnations of what some called Israeli war crimes. Social media lit up with anguished howls of grief and rage. Furious protests erupted throughout the Middle East. A historic synagogue in Tunisia was reportedly set alight, and a synagogue was attacked with a firebomb in Berlin. The leaders of Jordan and Egypt canceled a meeting with President Biden, where they would have discussed aid to Gaza. Of course, I’d read Israel’s insistence that an errant Islamic Jihad rocket had caused the explosion at the hospital, but I didn’t put much stock in it, because in the past when Israel accidentally killed civilians, it has blamed Palestinians for the deaths. In May of last year, the Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was shot and killed while covering an Israeli raid on the Jenin refugee camp. Israeli officials said she was shot either by a Palestinian or by an Israeli soldier aiming at a Palestinian gunman. A New York Times investigation, however, contradicted the official Israeli line. It found that the bullet that killed Abu Akleh was fired from the direction of an Israeli military convoy and that “there were no armed Palestinians near her when she was shot.” A few months later, during another round of Israeli bombing of Gaza, five Palestinian boys were killed in a cemetery. Initially, Israeli officials blamed a misfired Islamic Jihad rocket for the deaths. But as the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported, an army inquiry found they were actually killed by an Israeli airstrike. With the hospital explosion, it seemed history was repeating itself on a larger and more tragic scale. Perhaps it was, just not in the way I thought. As I write this, it looks increasingly likely that Israel was correct about an Islamic Jihad rocket hitting Al-Ahli hospital. That, at least, is what both early American intelligence and a number of independent experts have found. If their analysis holds up, it means the best analogy for this world-convulsing event is not the killings of five boys in Gaza last year. It is the myth of a massacre at the Jenin refugee camp in 2002. That year, a Hamas suicide bomber killed 30 people at a Passover Seder in the seaside city of Netanya, in what was, until this month, the deadliest single attack on Jewish Israelis since the country’s founding. As part of its response, Israel Defense Forces invaded the West Bank city of Jenin, leveling dozens of refugee camp buildings. Palestinian leaders claimed Israel had committed a massacre; the Palestinian official Saeb Erekat told CNN that at least 500 people had been killed. People all over the world believed these reports; as a BBC headline put it, “Jenin ‘massacre evidence growing.’” But Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the United Nations later concluded that the reports of a massacre weren’t true. The real Palestinian death toll was less than 60 — still an awful number but significantly fewer than what was feared. Human Rights Watch soon revealed that its researchers had found “no evidence to sustain claims of massacres or large-scale extrajudicial executions by the I.D.F. in Jenin refugee camp,” even though many of the civilian deaths “amounted to unlawful or willful killings by the I.D.F.” This finding, that the Israeli military had committed only a small fraction of the extrajudicial killings it was accused of, was not an exoneration. But it should have been a cautionary tale about accepting incendiary claims of Israeli atrocities at face value. The rush to judgment on Tuesday night will continue to haunt us all. Not long after the allegations emerged of a massacre in Jenin, The Guardian said, “Jenin already has that aura of infamy that attaches to a crime of especial notoriety,” predicting that it would “live on in memory and myth.” The Guardian was wrong about the scale of death in Jenin but right about the afterlife of the rumors. The narrative that Israel perpetrated a massacre at Al-Ahli will soon take on the same aura of infamy, with the amateur forensics of the internet only making it worse. In much of the world, there will be no dissuading people from holding Israel and, by extension, America liable for the hospital bombing. At the same time, Israel will be able to use this episode to deflect criticism of the violence it really is inflicting on the Palestinians. Jews, whatever their views about Zionism, will be placed in greater danger. As this hideous war grinds on, there will almost certainly be other enormities. We will only compound the horrors if we pretend to be instantly certain about them.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,12,928,0.053,0.091,0.04,0.5,0.5,0.046,0.122,0.106,0.123,0.5,0.5
234,45219,Daniel Kurtzer,The New York Times,Why Egypt Can’t Solve Gaza’s Problems,"In this period of intense Israeli military preparation following Hamas’s horrific terror attack on Oct. 7, and equally intense diplomatic activities surrounding the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip, a crucial question has centered on Egypt’s role. Why has Egypt appeared hesitant to relieve the humanitarian distress affecting Palestinian civilians on the other side of its eight -mile border with Gaza, especially since there really is no alternative to Cairo helping deal with the crisis? Finding an answer lies in Egypt’s own challenges, and whether a nation with its own serious security problems and economic problems can be enough of a safe haven for others. Egypt has, along with Israel, blockaded Gaza on and off for 16 years, containing the enclave’s largely Muslim population while Cairo deals with its own insurgent threat in the area. It must worry about the political complications that could come from a large influx of Palestinians. Inevitably, Egypt will in some sense have to pivot, now, and treat those living a few miles away as neighbors in crisis, rather than a problem to be penned in. The announcement on Wednesday that Israel has agreed to allow a batch of humanitarian supplies to enter Gaza from Egypt is surely welcome, as the aid will finally begin to address an extremely dire situation on the ground. Poverty and social-economic distress in Gaza were already serious problems before this war, with more than two million people crowded into one of the most densely populated areas of the world. When I visited Gaza regularly in the early 1980s as part of my responsibilities then in the U.S. Embassy in Israel, the crisis was already evident — high unemployment, subsistence living conditions and a pervasive lack of hope. Over 16 years of Hamas’s control have worsened the situation considerably. Now, the Israeli siege in response to the Hamas attacks, including cuts to power, water supplies and communications amid continuing bombardment, has created even more catastrophic conditions. Egypt has no love lost for Hamas, the Palestinian movement that is an offshoot of Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood. The Egyptian authorities have had a fractured relationship with the Brotherhood since its founding in 1928, including several serious and violent confrontations. Elements of a Brotherhood offshoot in the army — the Egyptian Islamic Jihad — were responsible for the 1981 assassination of President Anwar Sadat. The movement helped influence militants such as Ayman al-Zawahri, who became a leading figure in Al Qaeda. Egypt’s self-interest has been to keep the Brotherhood in check, to deal with other extremist elements in Sinai and thus to be wary of Hamas, centered just across the border in Gaza. At the same time, Egypt has managed to retain channels of communication with Hamas that have proven to be extremely important during the Islamist group’s frequent confrontations with Israel. Working alone, or in conjunction with Qatar, Turkey and Germany, among others, Egypt has jumped in early during these conflicts to help pave the way for a cease-fire and to start thinking about the post-conflict situation. This occurred in the extended Israel-Hamas war in 2014 and the confrontation in 2021. For this reason, and by virtue of Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula sitting on the other side of the Rafah crossing point, attention has focused on Egypt as a prime player in the effort to address the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza. Egypt has maintained tight control over its border with Gaza since Hamas took power there in 2007, including periods when the border was closed to the movement of people. Since the Hamas attack on Israel, Egypt has agreed to allow some humanitarian supplies in but has rejected a humanitarian corridor across the border to allow people to leave via Rafah. Egypt and Israel have also not reached agreement to allow foreign passport holders, including Palestinians, to leave through Rafah. The diplomats now dealing with Egypt need to contend with at least three factors. First, Egypt continues to face a serious security situation of its own in the Sinai Peninsula. Extremists, believed to be associated with Al Qaeda and ISIS, have been engaged in a decade-long insurgency against the Egyptian government. Operating in a large area, with difficult terrain and a small population, the insurgents have yet to be fully defeated. Egyptians may believe that the introduction of a large, traumatized refugee population in Sinai could offer the militants a potential pool of new recruits. Egypt also may fear that Hamas operatives could mingle among the refugees, enter Egypt, and present an additional security threat. Second, many Palestinians oppose the idea of leaving Gaza, even if it is announced as a temporary measure. Gaza is populated by more than a million descendants of refugees from the Arab-Israeli war of 1948-49, and this population is therefore sensitive to the possibility that what is announced as a temporary relocation could become permanent. Egypt is also sensitive to this possibility and does not want to house a large Palestinian refugee population for an extended period. Third, Egypt is a country with a large population of impoverished people. It already hosts hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers and refugees; even if the international community assumes responsibility for temporary Gazan refugees, Egypt may worry that they will remain for an extended period of time. Even with outside assistance, this will drain Egyptian resources and create further strain on the Egyptian economy and an additional security problem of its own, as young people in the camps become frustrated with the situation. It also does not want to be seen, by hosting Gazan refugees, as tacitly supporting Israel’s policy toward Palestinians. Despite these challenges, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and others nonetheless are working with Egypt to create conditions for humanitarian relief to reach the Palestinians in southern Gaza who left their homes after Israel’s massing of troops on the Gaza Strip border and warning of an imminent military action. While Egypt has said it is ready to ease the movement through Rafah of food, water, medical supplies and other emergency necessities, a complicating factor moving forward will be how to prevent those supplies from reaching Hamas and inadvertently supporting its terrorist activities; it is not always possible to distinguish between ordinary civilians and Hamas fighters dressed in civilian clothes. And, if international aid workers delivering the goods are unarmed, they could be threatened by armed Hamas fighters anxious to hijack the humanitarian supplies. The uncertainty of continued humanitarian access will pose a serious dilemma for American policymakers. As President Biden has made clear, the United States strongly supports efforts to meet the basic needs of Palestinians in Gaza. However, continued Israeli bombing and the likelihood of a ground offensive could make the provision of humanitarian supplies dangerous and put United Nations and other aid workers in jeopardy. A humanitarian deal could collapse even before it gets off the ground. The administration therefore needs to plan now for meeting Gaza’s immediate needs — which might require an early call on Israel for a humanitarian cease-fire — but must also develop a plan for the day after. Egypt will play a major role in any day-after plan, not only because of its proximity to Gaza, but also because of the weight it carries in the Arab world. While Egypt will eschew a direct role in governing Gaza, even temporarily, it needs to be consulted closely on any transitional arrangement put in place.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6,1232,0.078,0.157,0.329,0.5,0.5,0.146,0.358,0.12,0.276,0.5,0.5
235,45218,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,Israel Is About to Make a Terrible Mistake,"I have great admiration for how President Biden has used his empathy and physical presence in Israel to convince Israelis that they are not alone in their war against the barbaric Hamas, while trying to reach out to moderate Palestinians. Biden, I know, tried really hard to get Israeli leaders to pause in their rage and think three steps ahead — not only about how to get into Gaza to take down Hamas but also about how to get out — and how to do it with the fewest civilian casualties possible. While the president expressed deep understanding of Israel’s moral and strategic dilemma, he pleaded with Israeli military and political leaders to learn from America’s rush to war after Sept. 11, which took our troops deep into the dead ends and dark alleys of unfamiliar cities and towns in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, from everything I have gleaned from senior U.S. officials, Biden failed to get Israel to hold back and think through all the implications of an invasion of Gaza for Israel and the United States. So let me put this in as stark and clear language as I can, because the hour is late: I believe that if Israel rushes headlong into Gaza now to destroy Hamas — and does so without expressing a clear commitment to seek a two-state solution with the Palestinian Authority and end Jewish settlements deep in the West Bank — it will be making a grave mistake that will be devastating for Israeli interests and American interests. It could trigger a global conflagration and explode the entire pro-American alliance structure that the United States has built in the region since Henry Kissinger engineered the end of the Yom Kippur War in 1973. I am talking about the Camp David peace treaty, the Oslo peace accords, the Abraham Accords and the possible normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. The whole thing could go up in flames. This is not about whether Israel has the right to retaliate against Hamas for the savage barbarism it inflicted on Israeli men, women, babies and grandparents. It surely does. This is about doing it the right way — the way that does not play into the hands of Hamas, Iran and Russia. If Israel goes into Gaza and takes months to kill or capture every Hamas leader and soldier but does so while expanding Jewish settlements in the West Bank — thereby making any two-state solution there with the more moderate Palestinian Authority impossible — there will be no legitimate Palestinian or Arab League or European or U.N. or NATO coalition that will ever be prepared to go into Gaza and take it off Israel’s hands. There will be no one to extract Israel and no one to help Israel pay the cost of caring for more than two million Gazans — not if Israel is run by a government that thinks, and acts, as if it can justifiably exact its revenge on Hamas while unjustifiably building an apartheidlike society run by Jewish supremacists in the West Bank. That is a completely incoherent policy. Alas, though, a senior U.S. official told me that the Biden team left Jerusalem feeling that while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel understands that overreach in Gaza could set the whole neighborhood ablaze, his right-wing coalition partners are eager to fan the flames in the West Bank. Settlers there have killed at least seven Palestinian civilians in acts of revenge in just the past week. Meanwhile, U.S. officials told me, the representatives of those settlers in the cabinet are withholding tax money owed the Palestinian Authority, making it harder for it to keep the West Bank as under control as it has been since the start of the Hamas war. Netanyahu should not allow this, but he has trapped himself. He needs those right-wing extremists in his coalition to keep himself out of jail on corruption charges. But he is going to put all of Israel into the jail of Gaza unless he breaks with those Jewish supremacists. Unfortunately, the senior U.S. official told me, Israeli military leaders are actually more hawkish than the prime minister now. They are red with rage and determined to deliver a blow to Hamas that the whole neighborhood will never forget. I understand why. But friends don’t let friends drive while enraged. Biden has to tell this Israeli government that taking over Gaza without pairing it with a totally new approach to settlements, the West Bank and a two-state solution would be a disaster for Israel and a disaster for America. We can help, we can even insist, that our Arab and European allies work to create a more effective, less corrupt and more legitimate Palestinian Authority in the West Bank that, after some transition in Gaza, could help govern there as well. But not without a fundamental change in Israeli policy toward the PA and the Jewish settlers. Otherwise, what began as a Hamas onslaught against Israel has the potential to trigger a Middle East war with every great power and regional power having a hand in it — which would make it very difficult to stop once it started. In the first week of this conflict, the supreme leader of Iran and Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Hezbollah militia in Lebanon, appeared to be keeping very tight control of their militiamen on the border with Israel and in Iraq, Syria and Yemen. But as the second week has gone on, U.S. officials have picked up increasing signs that both leaders are letting their forces more aggressively attack Israeli targets and that they might attack American targets if the United States intervenes. They smell the logic of how much an Israeli invasion of Gaza could help their goal of driving America out of the whole region. On Thursday, a U.S. Navy warship in the northern Red Sea shot down three cruise missiles and several drones, apparently launched by the pro-Iranian Houthi militia in Yemen, that might have been headed toward Israel. More missiles, likely from pro-Iranian militias, were fired at U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria. So many rockets are now coming from the pro-Iranian Hezbollah militia in South Lebanon that we are one degree away from a full-scale missile war between Israel and Iran’s proxies — and very possibly directly between Israel and Iran. Israel is not likely to let Iran use its proxies to hit Israel without eventually firing a missile directly at Tehran. Israel has missile-armed submarines that are probably in the Persian Gulf as we speak. If that gets going, it’s Katie, bar the door. The United States, Russia and China could all be drawn in directly or indirectly. What makes the situation triply dangerous is that even if Israel acts with herculean restraint to prevent civilian deaths in Gaza, it won’t matter. Think of what happened at Gaza City’s Ahli Arab Hospital on Tuesday. As the Israeli columnist Nahum Barnea pointed out to me, Palestinian Islamic Jihad achieved more this week with an apparently misfired rocket “than it achieved in all of its successful missile launches.” How so? After that rocket failed and fell on the Palestinian hospital in Gaza, killing scores of people, Hamas and Islamic Jihad rushed out and claimed — with no evidence — that Israel had deliberately bombed the hospital, setting streets ablaze across the Arab world. When Israel and the United States offered compelling evidence a few hours later that Islamic Jihad accidentally hit the Gaza hospital with its own rocket, it was already too late. The Arab street was on fire, and a meeting of Arab leaders with Biden was canceled. If people cannot talk openly and honestly about a misfired rocket, imagine what will happen when the first major Israeli invasion of Gaza begins in our wired world, linked by social networks and polluted with misinformation amplified by artificial intelligence. That is why I believe that Israel would be much better off framing any Gaza operation as “Operation Save Our Hostages” — rather than “Operation End Hamas Once and for All” — and carrying it out, if possible, with repeated surgical strikes and special forces that can still get the Hamas leadership but also draw the brightest possible line between Gazan civilians and the Hamas dictatorship. But if Israel feels it must reoccupy Gaza to destroy Hamas and restore its deterrence and security — I repeat — it must pair that military operation with a new commitment to pursue a two-state solution with those Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza ready to make peace with Israel. The hour is late. I have never written a column this urgent before because I have never been more worried about how this situation could spin out of control in ways that could damage Israel irreparably, damage U.S. interests irreparably, damage Palestinians irreparably, threaten Jews everywhere and destabilize the whole world. I beg Biden to tell Israelis this immediately — for their sake, for America’s sake, for the sake of Palestinians, for the sake of the world.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,8,1514,0.046,0.81,0.274,0.171,0.5,0.679,0.587,0.178,0.323,0.5,0.5
236,45217,Farnaz Fassihi,The New York Times,An Iranian state television segment envisioned how attacks on Israel could unfold.,"Iranian officials have publicly warned that new fronts against Israel could open in the region if its offensive on Gaza continued, and on Wednesday Iran’s state television aired a segment detailing how such attacks could unfold. The report opened with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,  saying that if the war continued “nobody could stop the forces of the resistance,” referring to a network of militia groups across the region supported by Iran. Houthis in Yemen from the south, Syrian and Iraqi militias in Syria from the east, and Hezbollah in Lebanon from the north would coordinate to attack Israel with missiles and drones to create “a siege from every side,” the report claimed. Iran’s state television routinely broadcasts the Islamic Republic’s propaganda and hyperbole. The military threats could be part of a strategy to fuel a growing anxiety of the Israel-Hamas war’s expanding in the region. The segment said that Houthis in Yemen had missiles with a range of more than 1,200 miles and that Hezbollah in Lebanon had a cache of advanced missiles that could target Israeli warships in the Mediterranean Sea as well as the city of Tel Aviv. The report said Iraqi militia groups had taken positions alongside Syrian militias near the Golan Heights, an area Israel captured from Syria in 1967 and later annexed. Younis Shadlou, the state television reporter who identified himself as the narrator in his sign-off at the end of the three-and-a-half-minute piece, said that “these operations could happen in the next few days” if Ayatollah Khamenei’s call for an end to Gaza’s bombardment wasn’t heeded. Tensions are already flaring. Since Hamas launched its deadly attack in southern Israel, Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon have been exchanging fire along Israel’s northern border daily, with casualties reported on both sides. So far, the fighting has not spread beyond the border area...“If the bombing continues, it is vital that fighting not spread to other theaters,” said the International Crisis Group, a conflict prevention organization, in its latest report on the Israel-Hamas war issued on Wednesday. “Iran, which has been sounding ominous warnings about an expansion of the conflict, has the capacity to aggravate the situation.”",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12,361,0.238,0.233,0.132,0.5,0.5,0.196,0.216,0.5,0.219,0.5,0.5
237,45217,Farnaz Fassihi,The New York Times,The U.S. vetoes a Security Council resolution on the Israel-Hamas conflict.,"The American ambassador said the U.S. couldn’t support a measure that didn’t mention Israel’s right to self-defense. The United Nations Security Council displayed deep divisions on Wednesday when it failed to pass a resolution on the Israel-Hamas war as the humanitarian situation in Gaza deteriorated and the conflict risked spreading to the region. The resolution had the support of the majority of the Council members and had been expected to be adopted. The U.S. veto generated criticism of American double standards and accusations that the United States, which had criticized Russia for paralyzing the Council on the war in Ukraine, was impeding the work of the Council. But the American ambassador said the U.S. couldn’t support the resolution without a mention of Israel’s right to self-defense. Brazil, which holds the rotating presidency of the Council this month, had put forth the resolution, which called for humanitarian access and protection of civilians in Gaza, the immediate release of Israeli hostages and condemned Hamas’s terrorist attack on Israel. The Security Council has struggled to respond to Hamas’s terrorist attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, which killed more than 1,400 people and left nearly 200 others as hostages. Israel has replied with retaliatory strikes on Gaza, killing more than 3,000 Palestinians and injuring more than 9,000, including nearly 1,000 children, according to the U.N. The Israeli ambassador, Gilad Erdan, and the Palestinian representative at the U.N., Riyad Mansour, both said the Council had failed them. Mr. Erdan said he was unable to fathom how the Council could fail to collectively condemn Hamas’s terrorist attacks. “Calling for calm, restraint and cease-fire is like putting a Band-Aid on a bullet wound,” he said. “Such steps would not eradicate the cancer that is Hamas.” Mr. Mansour called on the Council to demand an immediate cease-fire. “The Security Council of the United Nations is unable to say the one thing that truly matters: stop the bloodshed,” he said. The U.N.’s special coordinator for the Israel-Palestine peace process said the organization was engaging with all sides to open a humanitarian channel from the Rafah border in Egypt where convoys carrying aid have lined up. “I fear that we are at the brink of a deep and dangerous abyss that could change the trajectory of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, if not of the Middle East as a whole,” said the official, Tor Wennesland.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,11,393,0.13,0.139,0.113,0.5,0.5,0.079,0.179,0.079,0.091,0.5,0.5
238,45217,Julian Barnes,The New York Times,Early U.S. and Israeli Intelligence Says Palestinian Group Caused Hospital Blast,"U.S. officials cautioned that the analysis is preliminary and that the United States was continuing to collect and analyze evidence. American and Israeli officials said their intelligence showed that the deadly blast at a Gaza hospital on Tuesday was caused by an armed Palestinian group, rebutting Palestinian claims that an Israeli strike caused the explosion. The U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive information, said they were basing their early analysis on multiple strands of intelligence indicating that the blast at Ahli Arab hospital was caused by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a group allied with Hamas. The group said Israel’s accusations that one of its rockets malfunctioned and hit the hospital were “false and baseless.” Hamas has not provided any documentation of Israeli involvement. The officials cautioned that the analysis was preliminary and that they were continuing to collect and analyze evidence. Neither side’s claims about who was responsible have been independently verified. The American intelligence, first mentioned by President Biden, includes satellite and other infrared data showing a launch of a rocket or missile from Palestinian fighter positions within Gaza. American intelligence agencies have also analyzed open-source video — recordings collected by journalists and others — of the launch showing that it did not come from the direction of Israeli military positions, the officials said.

The students say it’s a campaign to shut them up. On a campus already bitterly divided, the statement poured acid all over Harvard Yard. A coalition of more than 30 student groups posted an open letter on the night of the Hamas attack, saying that Israel was “entirely responsible” for the violence that ended up killing more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians. The letter, posted on social media before the extent of the killings was known, did not include the names of individual students. But within days, students affiliated with those groups were being doxxed, their personal information posted online. Siblings back home were threatened. Wall Street executives demanded a list of student names to ban their hiring. And a truck with a digital billboard — paid for by a conservative group — circled Harvard Square, flashing student photos and names, under the headline, “Harvard’s Leading Antisemites.” Campuses have long wrestled with free speech. What is acceptable to say and what crosses into hate speech? But the war between Israel and Hamas has heightened emotions, threatening to tear apart already fragile campus cultures. Complicating it all: outside groups, influential alumni and big-money donors, who are putting maximum pressure on students and administrators. At the University of Pennsylvania, donors are pushing for the resignation of the president and the board chairman, after a Palestinian writers’ conference on campus invited speakers accused of antisemitism. At Harvard, a billionaire couple quit an executive board. Another donor pulled money for fellowships. And Lawrence Summers, a former Harvard president and Treasury secretary, criticized the leadership for a “delayed” response to the Hamas attack and the student letter.

The authorities blamed an Israeli airstrike, but the assertion was disputed by the Israel Defense Forces, which blamed an errant rocket fired by an armed Palestinian faction. In video clips verified by The New York Times, scores of Palestinian bodies were filmed strewn across the courtyard of the Ahli Arab Hospital, some bloodied, charred, mangled or in pieces. “There were so many bodies I couldn’t even photograph,” said Ali Jadallah, a photographer for the Anadolu Agency who witnessed some of the first victims arriving at Al-Shifa Hospital, another health facility nearby. Early reports of the explosion and its attribution to Israel set off unrest in parts of the Middle East and drew furious condemnation from Arab leaders....After a two-hour review, the Israeli military said that the blast was caused by a rocket fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an armed group in Gaza that participated in the terrorist attacks on Israel on Oct. 7 that killed at least 1,400 people. The group later denied responsibility and an Israeli government account deleted video that it had posted as evidence of the military’s claim. In the past, rockets fired by Palestinian armed groups, including Islamic Jihad, have occasionally malfunctioned and hit civilian neighborhoods...The Saudi foreign ministry released a statement blaming the catastrophe at the hospital squarely on “the forces of the Israeli occupation,” calling it a “barbaric attack” that was a “flagrant violation of international law and norms.” Egypt also immediately blamed Israel for the attack and strongly condemned what it said were Israel’s “deliberate strikes on civilian facilities and targets.” In a statement, Hamas described the attack as “a horrific massacre” and “a crime of genocide.” The group called on Palestinians across the West Bank and Israel as well as the international community to “rally and take to the streets” following the strike.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17,340,0.085,0.091,0.134,0.5,0.5,0.071,0.15,0.199,0.063,0.5,0.5

Israel’s northern border with Lebanon is being closely monitored as the first potential flashpoint where the war could spread. Iran’s foreign minister warned on Monday that a regional network of militias known in parts of the Middle East as the “axis of resistance” would open “multiple fronts” against Israel if its attacks continued to kill civilians in Gaza. “Time is running out very fast,” the official, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, said during a live televised interview with Iranian state television on Monday night. “If the war crimes against the Palestinians are not immediately stopped, other multiple fronts will open and this is inevitable.” Mr. Amir Abdollahian spoke after returning to Tehran from a tour of capitals aligned or close to Iran. He met the top political official of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, in Doha, Qatar; the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, in Beirut; and President Bashar al-Assad of Syria in Damascus. In the interview, he said that in those meetings, the leaders of what is regionally called “the resistance” told him that “their hands are on the trigger” and said that “pre-emptive action” was possible “in the coming few hours” because those leaders would “naturally not allow the Zionist regime to do whatever it wants in Gaza” and then turn its attention to them....“The time has completely run out for these kinds of messages from America,” Mr. Amir Abdollahian said. “I would like to warn that, instead of sending us deceitful messages, stop the war crimes against women and children before it’s too late.” Iran’s ties to Hamas are under scrutiny because it remains the only state that has provided the terrorist group with military support. Iranian officials have publicly denied being involved or ordering the attack but have praised Hamas. Mr. Amir Abdollahian said that Iran did not give orders to the leaders of the “resistance axis” and that they are autonomous in their decision making. Asked by the state television news anchor if Iran would enter the war, he said: “Anything is possible.

244,45215,Michelle Goldberg,The New York Times,Piling Horror Upon Horror,"Watching from afar as people race toward an abyss, I find it hard to know what to write except “no,” over and over. In the face of massacres that for Jews around the world brought back memories of genocide, the language of some Israeli leaders has, in turn, become murderous. On the cusp of a likely ground invasion of Gaza, many people I’ve spoken to, Jewish and Palestinian alike, are terrified that this rhetoric will become reality. Isaac Herzog, Israel’s president, said that the “entire nation” of Gaza was “responsible” for the attacks at a news conference on Friday, telling reporters, “It is not true, this rhetoric about civilians not being aware, not involved.” Herzog later clarified that civilians are not legitimate targets, but his words, coming from a member of Israel’s center-left Labor Party, were still chilling, suggesting a broad political consensus that Gazans are collectively to blame for the horror that befell Israel. “All gloves are off,” Ron Prosor, a distinguished Israeli diplomat, told Politico. In such an environment, the ruling Israeli right, some of whose members spoke of forcing Palestinians out of Israel even before Hamas’s latest rampage, has little to restrain it. Tally Gotliv, a member of the Knesset from Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party, urged the use of “doomsday weapons” on Gaza. Another member of Likud called for a second nakba, the Arabic word referring to the mass expulsion of Palestinians at Israel’s creation in 1948. I can empathize with liberal Jews both in Israel and throughout the diaspora who feel too overwhelmed, at this moment of great fear and vulnerability, to protest the escalating suffering inflicted on Palestinians. It is not fair that events are moving too quickly to give people time to grieve the victimization of their own community before being asked to try to prevent the victimization of others. Nevertheless, as atrocities are piled on atrocities, I hope Jews will attend to what is being threatened in our name. And all Americans should pay attention, given how much our country underwrites Israel’s military. In Gaza, mass death has already begun. Last week the defense minister, Yoav Gallant, announced that Israel was cutting off Gaza’s water, electricity, food and fuel. There was hopeful reporting over the weekend that at the urging of President Biden’s administration, water to a town in Gaza’s south had been turned back on, but for many, drinking water is still unavailable. The Associated Press reported on Sunday that clean water has run out in U.N. shelters across Gaza. On Saturday, UNICEF reported that, according to local sources, more than 700 children in Gaza had been killed. The number by now is surely higher. Some readers, I suspect, will respond that while this is all terrible, it is also all Hamas’s fault. In many ways, I agree. Hamas’s terror is clearly the immediate cause of the hell raining down on Gaza; most countries attacked as Israel was attacked would respond with war. That does not, however, license Israeli indifference, or worse, to the lives of civilians. Israelis have a right to their rage; I imagine that if I were Israeli, I would share it. But incitement against Palestinians, the overwhelming majority of whom have nothing to do with Hamas terrorism, is leading us toward somewhere even darker than where we are right now. Influential voices in America are intensifying the bloodthirsty atmosphere. Appearing on “Fox News Sunday,” the Republican senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas dismissed worries that mass civilian casualties in Gaza will work to Hamas’s advantage on the world stage. “As far as I’m concerned, Israel can bounce the rubble in Gaza,” he said. That phrase, “bounce the rubble,” is a reference to a Winston Churchill quote about apocalyptic military overkill. To Cotton’s right, the language is even more incendiary. “If it comes down to ethnic cleansing — you want to cleanse my people, I’ll cleanse yours first,” said Joel Pollak, a senior editor at large at Breitbart News, on the webcast of the leading young conservative Charlie Kirk. We can already see where the total dehumanization of Palestinians leads. This weekend, a 6-year-old boy in Illinois was allegedly stabbed to death by his landlord, who is also accused of gravely injuring the boy’s mother. According to the local sheriff’s office, the victims were targeted “due to them being Muslim and the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis.” If this is the atmosphere in parts of the United States, it is exponentially more fevered in Israel. On Monday morning I spoke to Diana Buttu, a Canadian Palestinian lawyer in Haifa who once served as a legal adviser for the Palestine Liberation Organization. “I can understand what my grandmother felt in 1948 when she fled” from a town near Nazareth, Buttu said. “Because it’s a climate of total fear that you’re next. And this isn’t just in the Gaza Strip; it’s also spread to the West Bank.” Already, according to Al Jazeera, at least 55 Palestinians in the West Bank have been killed, some by soldiers and others by settlers. Haaretz reported that five Palestinians were shot dead by settlers in the village of Qusra. A message to the village on WhatsApp said, “We have no red lines. We’ll punish you in order to make an example out of you.” Buttu sent me a link to a mostly Hebrew-language Telegram group with over 82,000 subscribers in which people had posted celebratory photographs of dead and injured Palestinians. “The people of Gaza are not innocent!” said an introductory message for English speakers.

245,45215,Sheera Frenkel,The New York Times,Hamas Posts Hostage Video of Woman Abducted From Israeli Music Festival,"The video, of Mia Schem, 21, was the first Hamas has released of any of its nearly 200 hostages. It showed her being treated for an arm injury and speaking to the camera. Hamas released a video late Monday of Mia Schem, one of the nearly 200 people believed to be held hostage in Gaza after the group launched a cross-border assault on Israel nine days ago. The 60-second video — the first released by the group to show any of the hostages — begins with Ms. Schem, 21, receiving medical treatment for a wound above her right elbow and shows her arm being wrapped in bandages by a person off-camera. The next images are of Ms. Schem, who disappeared from the site of a music festival where at least 260 people were killed, speaking directly to the camera in Hebrew. “At the moment I am in Gaza,” Ms. Schem says in a solemn, clipped voice. She says that she is being looked after and that her arm was operated on for three hours at a hospital. The video ends with her plea to be returned to Israel. “I just ask that I am returned as fast as possible to my family, to my parents, and to my siblings,” she says. “Please get us out of here as quickly as possible.” The Israeli military issued a statement after the video was released that said Hamas was “trying to portray itself as a humane organization, while it is a murderous terrorist organization responsible for the murder and abduction of babies, women, children and elderly.” A friend of the Schem family said the family had seen the clip and confirmed Ms. Schem’s identity. The friend requested anonymity, citing fears of harassment. The family name can also be transliterated as Shem. According to an analysis by The New York Times, metadata contained within the video file indicates that some of the footage was filmed at least six days ago. Israeli officials said on Monday that 199 people were being held captive by Hamas — about 50 more than previously known — in the wake of the attack, which left more than 1,400 victims dead. Israel has responded with heavy airstrikes on Gaza, the Palestinian enclave controlled by Hamas, and threats of a ground invasion.

246,45215,Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus,The New York Times,W.H.O. Chief: Doctors and Patients Face Impossible Choices in Gaza,"Al Shifa Hospital, the largest health care facility in the Gaza Strip, is emblematic of an unfolding humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. Already underresourced and overcrowded, it is now home to thousands of people who have sought refuge from Israeli airstrikes that rained down on their neighborhoods after the horrific and unjustified attacks by Hamas on Israeli civilians on Oct. 7. Al Shifa Hospital has always been under tremendous strain. When I visited in 2018, I met with patients and health workers and toured a dialysis unit and a neonatal intensive care ward, full of newborns in incubators. Their tentative grasp on life was sustained by diesel generators that powered the hospital when the electricity went off, as it did for several hours every day. Staff members, patients and their families faced difficult choices to make daily. These choices are now seemingly impossible in the fallout from Oct. 7 — not just at Al Shifa Hospital but at northern Gaza’s other hospitals and clinics as well. With no electricity and fuel running out in Gaza, within days hospital generators will fall silent, and the incubators, dialysis machines and other lifesaving medical equipment will shut down. Many of the most critically ill patients, including babies, whose lives have only just begun, will probably die. Attempting to move them is equally hazardous. Water scarcity is a grave concern for struggling patients, especially newborns. Israel’s order to empty 23 hospitals treating over 2,000 patients in Gaza presents health workers with a horrifying choice: Force those in their care to make a journey that for many will be their last or stay and treat their patients under the impending threat of bombardment. Health workers should never have to make choices like that, nor should they ever be targeted. Under international humanitarian law, all armed actors are obliged to proactively protect health facilities from intentional or collateral attack. But in this conflict, health facilities and health care have been struck repeatedly. I deplore the attacks on health facilities in both Gaza and Israel, which have led to the deaths and injuries of health workers on both sides. The deaths of colleagues from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency in Gaza brought even closer to home the dangers faced by humanitarian workers, including those providing health relief. There’s still time and opportunity to prevent the worst-case scenario. The World Health Organization calls for the immediate and safe release of hostages seized from Israel and taken into Gaza by Hamas. According to the Israeli military, some 199 hostages seized from Israel that day — children, adults and older people — remain hostage in Gaza, many in need of medical treatment. And we hope for attacks on Israeli hospitals to cease as well; Barzilai Medical Center in Ashkelon, which has treated both Israelis and Palestinians for years, has been hit by Hamas rocket attacks, damaging one of the few medical reference centers available to the people of Gaza. We continue to appeal to all parties to abide by their obligations under international law to protect civilians and health facilities. We appeal to Israel to restore supplies of electricity and water and to support the establishment of a humanitarian corridor into Gaza. In Cairo last week, I met with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, who generously agreed to facilitate the delivery of medical supplies to Gaza through the Rafah border crossing with the help of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society. On Saturday, the W.H.O. delivered a planeload of supplies to Egypt from our logistics hub in Dubai, and we are working to move these supplies into Gaza as rapidly as possible. We appeal for sustained, unhindered and protected humanitarian access. This will help civilians to move to safety in Gaza, health facilities to be restocked with medicines and other supplies, fuel to reach hospitals to keep generators and the lifesaving equipment they support running, and clean water and food to arrive to sustain the weak and weary. To be clear, as a United Nations agency, the W.H.O. is politically impartial and is committed to supporting the health and well-being of all Israelis and Palestinians. To that end, the agency established an official presence in Israel in 2019, adding to our existing office in the occupied territory. On my visits in 2018 and last year, I met with the ministers of health of both Israel and the occupied territory to discuss how the W.H.O. can better support both governments to promote, provide and protect the health care of their people. This included a visit to the Sheba Medical Center near Tel Aviv, where I was encouraged by Israeli health specialists developing digital health initiatives in partnership with Palestinian communities. Since Oct. 7, however, so many horrifying choices have been made — abhorrent attacks on civilians in Israel by Hamas and other armed groups, the seizing of hostages, the attacks on populated areas of Gaza. What is needed now is another kind of decision making, one that ensures hospitals are kept operational, supplies are safeguarded and health workers and civilians in Israel and Gaza are protected and sustained. Nelson Mandela once said, “May your choices reflect your hopes, not your fears.” At this fearful time, I appeal to all who have the power to make decisions that affect the health and well-being of so many people to choose, as Mr. Mandela implored, the way of hope.There is still time.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10,899,0.229,0.192,0.624,0.5,0.5,0.096,0.087,0.761,0.111,0.5,0.5
247,45215,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,Why a Gaza Invasion and ‘Once and for All’ Thinking Are Wrong for Israel,"When The Times’s Israel correspondent Isabel Kershner recently asked an Israeli Army tank driver, Shai Levy, 37, to describe the purpose of the looming Israeli invasion of Gaza, he said something that really caught my ear. It was “to restore honor to Israel,” he said. “The citizens are relying on us to defeat Hamas and remove the threat from Gaza once and for all.” That caught my ear because, over the years, I’ve learned that four of the most dangerous words in the Middle East are “once and for all.” All these Islamist/jihadist movements — the Taliban, Hamas, ISIS, Al Qaeda, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah, the Houthis — have deep cultural, social, religious and political roots in their societies. And they have access to endless supplies of humiliated young men, many of whom have never been in a job, power or a romantic relationship: a lethal combination that makes them easy to mobilize for mayhem. And that’s why, to this day, none of these movements have been eliminated once and for all. They can, though, be isolated, diminished, delegitimized and decapitated — as America has done with ISIS and Al Qaeda. But that requires patience, precision, lots of allies and alternatives that have legitimacy within the societies from which these young men emerge. And so let me say loudly and clearly what I have been saying quietly in my past few columns: I am with President Biden when he told “60 Minutes” that it would be a “big mistake” for Israel “to occupy Gaza again.” I believe that such a move could turn Israel’s humiliating tactical defeat at the hands of Hamas, which included unimaginable barbarism, into a long-term moral and military strategic crisis. It’s one that could entrap Israel in Gaza, draw the U.S. into another Middle East war and undermine three of America’s most important foreign policy interests right now: helping Ukraine wrestle free of Russia to join the West, containing China and shaping a pro-American bloc that includes Egypt, Israel, moderate Arab countries and Saudi Arabia, which could counterbalance Iran and fight the global threat of radical Islam. If Israel goes into Gaza now, it will blow up the Abraham Accords, further destabilize two of America’s most important allies (Egypt and Jordan) and make normalization with Saudi Arabia impossible — huge strategic setbacks. It will also enable Hamas to really fire up the West Bank and get a shepherd’s war going there between Jewish settlers and Palestinians. Altogether, it will play directly into Iran’s strategy of sucking Israel into imperial overstretch and in that way weakening the Jewish democracy from within. Iran’s No. 1 strategic objective with Israel has always been to ensure that Israel remains enmeshed in the West Bank, gets drawn into reoccupying southern Lebanon and, in Iran’s most fevered dreams, reoccupies Gaza. Such an Israel would be so morally, economically and militarily enfeebled, it could never threaten Iran’s nuclear program and hegemonic ambitions. What should Israel do to ensure that an attack like the one launched by Hamas never happens again? I don’t know right now. I just know that whatever the answer is, it’s not mobilizing 360,000 traumatized Israeli reservists to launch into an urban war in one of the most densely populated places in the world. This will crush the Israeli economy and its international standing. All these dilemmas must push Biden to sharpen his stance on the crisis. Biden must realize that Benjamin Netanyahu is unfit to manage this war as a rational player. After such a colossal defeat, the most powerful and unifying thing Netanyahu could have done was call new Israeli elections in six or nine months — and announce that he would not be running; he is ending his career in politics, and therefore Israelis can trust that whatever decisions he makes about Gaza and Hamas now will have only the Israeli national interest in mind; he will not have in mind his own interest in staying out of jail on corruption charges, which requires his holding on to the right-wing crazies in his government (who actually fantasize about Israel reoccupying Gaza and rebuilding the Israeli settlements there) by chasing some big, short-term military victory that he can take to the Israeli electorate as a compensation for the debacle that just happened. As one of Israel’s best military writers, Amos Harel of Haaretz, wrote on Friday: “There is an unusual combination of people at the top in Israel. On one hand, there is an unfit prime minister, a nearly Shakespearean figure who is facing the personal danger of an ignominious conclusion to an arguably brilliant career. Facing him are a military brass who are smitten and consumed with guilt feelings (and if only Netanyahu would bother displaying a smidgen of that). That’s not a perfect recipe for considered decision making.” If Israel were to announce today that it has decided for now to forgo an invasion of Gaza and will look for more surgical means to eliminate or capture Hamas’s leadership while trying to engineer a trade for the more than 150 Israeli and other hostages whom Hamas is holding, it would not only avoid further traumatizing its own society, as well as Palestinian civilians in Gaza; it would also give Israel and its allies time to think through how to build — with Palestinians — a legitimate alternative to Hamas. Such a move would earn Israel a lot of support globally and enable the world to see Hamas for what it is: the ISIS of the Palestinian territories. “In today’s world, whatever happens on the battlefield can be overturned in the information realm, so the battle of the story matters as much as the battle on the ground,” said John Arquilla, a retired professor of strategy at the Naval Postgraduate School. “If Israel overreacts in Gaza, it will drain out whatever residual good feelings toward Israel exist, and that is Hamas’s big bet. Israel has built so much, enjoys so much and contributes so much to the world and has so much more to contribute. To risk all that in an act of revenge or rage that will not fundamentally alter its strategic dilemmas is exceptionally unwise.” But, as I said, if Israel still decides it must enter Gaza to capture and kill Hamas’s leadership, it must only do so if it has in place a legitimate Palestinian leadership to replace Hamas — so Israel is not left governing there forever. If that happens, every day that the sun doesn’t shine in Gaza, the water doesn’t flow, the electricity doesn’t operate and hunger or disease becomes widespread will be the fault of every Israeli and even every Jew in the world. Is Israel ready for that burden? While Biden is right to support Israel, he must get clear answers from Netanyahu now, before it’s too late: Once Israel topples Hamas, who will govern Gaza? If Israel intends to govern Gaza, will it pay for the rebuilding of the infrastructure that it is destroying? And if not, who will? How long does Israel intend to allow the humanitarian crisis to unfold in southern Gaza? Does Israel plan to build settlements in Gaza? Does Israel respect Gaza’s borders? Does it have a plan to help rebuild the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank? The West Bank Palestinian Authority, under President Mahmoud Abbas, is weak, corrupt and increasingly illegitimate; it can’t manage the West Bank, let alone Gaza — which is how Netanyahu wanted it, so he could always say he did not have any partner for peace. But this is not all on Netanyahu. Believe it or not, folks, Palestinians have agency, too, and the corruption that the Palestinian Authority has tolerated, and the fact that Abbas banished the most effective leader it ever had, the former prime minister Salam Fayyad, is also a huge factor — something every friend of the Palestinians should be saying loudly, not just blaming Israel. But all that said, Israel has to completely rethink how it relates to the Palestinians in the West Bank — and therefore the whole settler movement as well — if it wants to replace Hamas in Gaza. If the settler movement continues to set the terms of what is permissible in Israeli politics, another disaster is looming in the West Bank. My bottom line? Just ask this question: If Israel announced today that it was forgoing, for now, a full-blown invasion of Gaza, who would be happy, and who would be relieved, and who would be upset? Iran would be totally frustrated, Hezbollah would be disappointed, Hamas would feel devastated — its whole war plan came to naught — and Vladimir Putin would be crushed, because Israel would not be burning up ammunition and weapons the U.S. needs to be sending to Ukraine. The settlers in the West Bank would be enraged. Meanwhile, the parents of every Israeli soldier and every Israeli held hostage would be relieved, every Palestinian in Gaza caught in the crossfire would be relieved, and every friend and ally Israel has in the world — starting with one Joseph R. Biden — would be relieved. I rest my case.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,14,1525,0.072,0.545,0.119,0.144,0.5,0.319,0.521,0.273,0.482,0.5,0.5
248,45215,Matthew Rosenberg,The New York Times,"Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’s Leader in Gaza, Is at the Top of Israel’s Target List","Considered a brutal enforcer within Hamas, he served time in Israeli prison before being released in a 2011 prisoner swap. The Israeli military calls Yahya Sinwar, the hard-line leader of Hamas in Gaza, the “face of evil.” And senior officers say he is the top target for the tens of thousands of Israeli troops poised to invade the coastal enclave and destroy its leadership. Long considered a brutal enforcer within Hamas and an implacable enemy of Israel, Mr. Sinwar served more than two decades in Israeli prisons before being released in a 2011 prisoner swap. He emerged as the militant group’s leader in Gaza — its top leadership resides abroad — in 2017. “Yahya Sinwar is the face of evil,” Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesman, said on Saturday after Hamas assailants killed more than 1,300 Israelis in a brutal incursion that began Oct. 7. “He is the mastermind behind this, like bin Laden was.” Israel has responded to the attack with punishing airstrikes and a massive military buildup ahead of a widely anticipated invasion of Gaza. In early 1988, Mr. Sinwar was arrested by Israeli forces and ultimately sentenced to four life terms in prison for killing two Israeli soldiers. Mr. Sinwar was released in 2011, the most senior of 1,100 Palestinian prisoners that Israel exchanged for one of its soldiers, Gilad Shalit, who had been captured by Hamas in a cross-border raid in 2006. At the time, Mr. Sinwar said he spent his time in prison studying the Israelis and, eventually, helping negotiate the prisoner swap. “They wanted the prison to be a grave for us. A mill to grind our will, determination and bodies,” Mr. Sinwar said after his release. “But thank God, with our belief in our cause we turned the prison into sanctuaries of worship and academies for study.” Six years later, he was chosen to lead Hamas in Gaza and set about consolidating his power. He is believed to have been behind the 2015 detention, torture and killing of a Hamas commander, Mahmoud Ishtiwi, who was accused of embezzlement and “moral crimes” — amid suspicions of gay sex — that Mr. Sinwar apparently feared could compromise the group.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14,366,0.173,0.088,0.412,0.5,0.5,0.098,0.087,0.444,0.287,0.5,0.5
249,45213,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,Why Israel Is Acting This Way,"With the Middle East on the cusp of a full-blown ground war, I was thinking on Friday morning about how Israel’s last two major wars have two very important things in common: They were both started by nonstate actors backed by Iran — Hezbollah from Lebanon in 2006 and Hamas from Gaza now — after Israel had withdrawn from their territories. And they both began with bold border-crossing assaults — Hezbollah killing three and kidnapping two Israeli soldiers in 2006 and Hamas brutally killing more than 1,300 and abducting some 150 Israeli civilians, including older people, babies and toddlers, in addition to soldiers. That similarity is not a coincidence. Both assaults were designed to challenge emerging trends in the Arab world of accepting Israel’s existence in the region. And most critically, the result of these surprise, deadly attacks across relatively stable borders was that they drove Israel crazy. In 2006, Israel essentially responded to Hezbollah: “You think you can just do crazy stuff like kidnap our people and we will treat this as a little border dispute. We may look Western, but the modern Jewish state has survived as ‘a villa in the jungle’” — which is how the former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak described it — “because if push comes to shove, we are willing to play by the local rules. Have no illusions about that. You will not outcrazy us out of this neighborhood.” So the Israeli Air Force relentlessly pounded the homes and offices of Hezbollah’s leadership in the southern suburbs of Beirut throughout the 34 days of the war, as well as key bridges into and out of the city and Beirut International Airport. Hezbollah’s leaders and their families and neighbors paid a very personal price. The Israeli response was so ferocious that Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said in a now famous interview on Aug. 27, 2006, with Lebanon’s New TV station, shortly after the war ended: “We did not think, even 1 percent, that the capture [of two Israeli soldiers] would lead to a war at this time and of this magnitude. You ask me, if I had known on July 11 … that the operation would lead to such a war, would I do it? I say no, absolutely not.” Indeed, since 2006, the Israel-Lebanon border has been relatively stable and quiet, with few casualties on both sides. And while Israel did take a hit in terms of its global image because of the carnage it inflicted in Beirut, it was not nearly as isolated in the world or the Middle East over the short term or long run as Hezbollah had hoped. Hamas must have missed that lesson when it decided to disrupt the status quo around Gaza with an all-out attack on Israel last weekend. This is in spite of the fact that over the past few years, Israel and Hamas developed a form of coexistence around Gaza that allowed thousands of Gazans to enter Israel daily for work, filled Hamas coffers with cash aid from Qatar and gave Gazans the ability to do business with Israel, with Gazan goods being exported through Israeli seaports and airports. Hamas’s stated reasons for this war are that Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has been provoking the Palestinians by the morning strolls that Israel’s minister for national security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, was taking around Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem and by the steps that he was taking to make imprisonment of Palestinians harsher. While these moves by Israel were widely seen as provocations, they are hardly issues that justify Hamas putting all its chips on the table the way it did last Saturday. The bigger reason it acted now, which Hamas won’t admit, is that it saw how Israel was being more accepted by the Arab world and soon possibly by the birthplace of Islam, Saudi Arabia. Iran was being cornered by President Biden’s Middle East diplomacy, and Palestinians feared being left behind. So Hamas essentially said, “OK, Jews, we will go where we have never gone before. We will launch an all-out attack from Gaza that won’t stop with soldiers but will murder your grandparents and slaughter your babies. We know it’s crazy, but we are willing to risk it to force you to outcrazy us, with the hope that the fires will burn up all Arab-Israeli normalization in the process.” Yes, if you think Israel is now crazy, it is because Hamas punched it in the face, humiliated it and then poked out one eye. So now Israel believes it must restore its deterrence by proving that it can outcrazy Hamas’s latest craziness. Israel will apply Hama Rules — a term I coined years ago to describe the strategy deployed in 1982 by Syria’s president, Hafez al-Assad, when Hamas’s political forefathers, the Muslim Brotherhood of Syria, tried to topple Assad’s secular regime by starting a rebellion in the city of Hama. Assad pounded the Brotherhood’s neighborhoods in Hama relentlessly for days, letting no one out, and brought in bulldozers and leveled it as flat as a parking lot, killing some 20,000 of his own people in the process. I walked on that rubble weeks later. An Arab leader I know told me privately how, afterward, Assad laconically shrugged when he was asked about it: “People live. People die.” Welcome to the Middle East. This is not like a border dispute between Norway and Sweden or a heated debate in Harvard Yard. Lord, how I wish that it were, but it’s not. This Israel-Hamas war is part of an evolving escalation of craziness that has been underway in this neighborhood but getting more and more dangerous every year as weapons get bigger, cheaper and more lethal. Like Biden, I stand 100 percent with Israel against Hamas, because Israel is an ally that shares many values with America, while Hamas and Iran are opposed to what America stands for. That math is quite simple for me. But what makes this war different for me from any war before is Israel’s internal politics. In the past nine months, a group of Israeli far-right and ultra-Orthodox politicians led by Netanyahu tried to kidnap Israeli democracy in plain sight. The religious-nationalist-settler right, led by the prime minister, tried to take over Israel’s judiciary and other key institutions by eliminating the power of Israel’s Supreme Court to exercise judicial review. That attempt opened multiple fractures across Israeli society. Israel was recklessly being taken by its leadership to the brink of a civil war for an ideological flight of fancy. These fractures were seen by Iran, Hamas and Hezbollah and may have stirred their boldness. If you want to get just a little feel for those fractures — and the volcanic anger at Netanyahu for the way he divided the country before this war — watch the video that went viral in Israel two days ago when Idit Silman, a minister in Netanyahu’s ruling Likud party, was tossed out of the Assaf Harofeh Hospital in Tzrifin when she went to visit some wounded. “You’ve ruined this country. Get out of here,” an Israeli doctor yelled at her. “How are you not ashamed to wage another war?” another person told her. “Now it’s our turn,” the doctor can be heard screaming in a video published on X, formerly known as Twitter, and reported by The Forward. “We are in charge. We will govern here — right, left, a nation united — without you. You’ve ruined everything!” Israel has suffered a staggering blow and is now forced into a morally impossible war to outcrazy Hamas and deter Iran and Hezbollah at the same time. I weep for the terrible deaths that now await so many good Israelis and Palestinians. And I also worry deeply about the Israeli war plan. It is one thing to deter Hezbollah and deter Hamas. It is quite another to replace Hamas and leave behind something more stable and decent. But what to do? Finally, though, just as I stand today with Israel’s new unity government in its fight against Hamas to save Israel’s body, I will stand after this war with Israel’s democracy defenders against those who tried to abduct Israel’s soul.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6,1363,0.068,0.191,0.253,0.09,0.5,0.252,0.238,0.5,0.257,0.5,0.5
250,45210,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,Israel Has Never Needed to Be Smarter Than in This Moment,"I have covered this conflict for almost 50 years, and I’ve seen Israelis and Palestinians do a lot of awful things to one another: Palestinian suicide bombers blowing up Israeli discos and buses; Israeli fighter jets hitting neighborhoods in Gaza that house Hamas fighters but also causing massive civilian casualties. But I’ve not seen something like what happened last weekend: individual Hamas fighters rounding up Israeli men, women and children, looking them in the eyes, gunning them down and, in one case, parading a naked woman around Gaza to shouts of “Allahu akbar.” The last time I witnessed that level of face-to-face barbarism was the massacre of Palestinian men, women and children by Christian militiamen in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in Beirut in 1982, where the first victim I encountered was an older man with a white beard and a bullet hole in his temple. While I have no illusions about Hamas’s long-established commitment to the destruction of the Jewish state, I am nonetheless asking myself today: Where did this ISIS-like impulse for mass murder as the primary goal come from? Not the seizing of territory, but plain murder? There is something new here that is important to understand. Since I can’t interview the Hamas leadership, I’m drawing on my experience in the region, and here’s how I see it. While this operation was surely planned by Hamas leaders months ago, I think its emotional origins can be explained in part by a photograph that appeared in the Israeli press on Oct. 3. A few Israeli government ministers had gone to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, for their first official visit ever, to attend international conferences in late September and early October, and it got a lot of coverage in the Israeli press. But having lived in both Beirut and Jerusalem, I was struck most by that unusual photo — an image that I knew would trigger completely different emotional reactions in both worlds. It was taken by the team of Israel’s communications minister, Shlomo Karhi, who was attending a U.N. postal conference in Riyadh, as they were conducting a prayer service in their hotel room for the Jewish holiday of Sukkot. One of them took a picture of a colleague wearing a traditional Jewish prayer shawl and yarmulke while holding up a Torah scroll with the Riyadh skyline in the window beyond. For Israeli Jews, that picture is a dream come true — the ultimate expression of finally being accepted in the Middle East, more than a century after the start of the Zionist movement to build a modern democratic state in the biblical homeland of the Jewish people. To be able to pray with a Torah in Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam and the home of its two holiest cities, Mecca and Medina, is a level of acceptance that touches the soul of every Israeli Jew. But that same photo ignites a powerful and emotional rage in many Palestinians, particularly those affiliated with the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood, including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. For them, that picture is the full expression of the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s supreme goal: to prove to all naysayers, indeed to rub their noses in the fact, that he can make peace with all the Arab states — even Saudi Arabia — and not have to give the Palestinians a single inch. As far as diplomacy goes, that has been Netanyahu’s life’s mission: to prove to everyone that Israel can have its cake — acceptance by all the surrounding Arab states — and eat the Palestinians’ territory, too. I have no idea whether the Hamas leadership saw that particular picture, but they have been fully aware of the ongoing evolution it reflects. I believe one reason Hamas not only launched this assault now — but also seemingly ordered it to be as murderous as possible — was to trigger an Israeli overreaction, like an invasion of the Gaza Strip, that would lead to massive Palestinian civilian casualties and in that way force Saudi Arabia to back away from the U.S.-brokered deal now in discussion to promote normalization between Riyadh and the Jewish state. As well as to force the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco, which were part of the Abraham Accords produced by the Trump administration, to take a step back from Israel. The essence of Hamas’s message to Netanyahu and his far-right ruling coalition of Jewish supremacists and ultra-Orthodox is this: You will never be at home here — no matter how much of our land our gulf Arab brothers sell you. We will force you to lose your minds and do crazy things to Gaza that force the Arab states to shun you. Pay attention: Hamas did not send operatives to the Israeli-occupied West Bank (and it has plenty there) to attack Jewish settlements. It focused its onslaught on Israeli villages and kibbutz farms that were not part of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. “These were the homes of the people of pre-1967 Israel, democratic Israel, liberal Israel — living in peaceful kibbutzim or going to a life-loving disco party,” the Israeli writer Ari Shavit remarked to me. For Hamas, “Israel’s mere existence is a provocation,” he said. In one kibbutz alone, Be’eri, at least 108 people, including children, were just gunned down. So how can America best help Israel now, besides standing behind its right to protect itself, as President Biden so forcefully did in his speech today? I think the U.S. needs to do three things. First, I hope the president is asking Israel to ask itself this question as it considers what to do next in Gaza: What do my worst enemies want me to do — and how can I do just the opposite? What Israel’s worst enemies — Hamas and Iran — want is for Israel to invade Gaza and get enmeshed in a strategic overreach there that would make America’s entanglement in Falluja look like a children’s birthday party. We are talking house-to-house fighting that would undermine whatever sympathy Israel has garnered on the world stage, deflect world attention from the murderous regime in Tehran and force Israel to stretch its forces to permanently occupy Gaza and the West Bank. Hamas and Iran absolutely do not want Israel to refrain from going into Gaza very deep or long. Nor does Hamas want the U.S. and Israel to proceed instead as fast as possible with negotiations to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia as part of a deal that would also require Israel to make real concessions to the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, which has accepted Israel as part of the Oslo peace accords. But for Israel to do what is most in its interests, not those of Hamas and Iran, will likely require some very tough love between Biden and Netanyahu. One must never forget that Netanyahu always seemed to prefer to deal with a Hamas that was unremittingly hostile to Israel than with its rival, the more moderate Palestinian Authority — which Netanyahu did everything he could to discredit, even though the Palestinian Authority has long worked closely with Israeli security services to keep the West Bank quiet, and Netanyahu knows it. Netanyahu has never wanted the world to believe that there are “good Palestinians” ready to live side by side with Israel in peace and try to nurture them. For years now he’s always wanted to tell U.S. presidents: What do you want from me? I have no one to talk to on the Palestinian side. That’s how Israel reached a stage where the increasingly costly — morally and financially — Israeli occupation of the West Bank has not even been an issue in the last five Israeli elections. Or as Chuck Freilich, a former deputy Israeli national security adviser, wrote in an essay in Haaretz on Sunday: “For a decade and a half Prime Minister Netanyahu has sought to institutionalize the divide between the West Bank and Gaza, undermine the Palestinian Authority, the P.A., and conduct de facto cooperation with Hamas, all designed to demonstrate the absence of a Palestinian partner and to ensure that there could be no peace process that might have required territorial compromise in the West Bank.” Lastly, I hope Biden is telling Netanyahu that America will do everything it can to help democratic Israel defend itself from the theocratic fascists of Hamas — and their soul brothers of Hezbollah in Lebanon, should they enter the fight. But Netanyahu’s side of the bargain is that he has to reconnect himself with liberal democratic Israel, so the world and the region sees this not as a religious war but as a war between the frontline of democracy and the frontline of theocracy. That means Netanyahu has to change his cabinet, expel the religious zealots and create a national unity government with Benny Gantz and Yair Lapid. Unfortunately, Netanyahu is still prioritizing his coalition of zealots, whom he needs to protect him from his corruption trial and to complete his judicial coup that would neuter the Supreme Court of Israel. That’s really messed up. And it is a very important reason Israel was caught off guard in the first place. Netanyahu was so wedded to this personal agenda that he was ready to divide Israeli society like never before — and splinter his own army and air force in the process — to get control of the courts. I promise you that if and when there’s an inquiry into how the Israeli Army could have so missed this Hamas buildup, investigators will discover that the Israeli Army leadership had to spend so much time just keeping its air force pilots and reserve officers from boycotting their service to protest Netanyahu’s judicial coup — not to mention the time, attention and resources they had to devote to preventing extremist settlers and religious zealots from doing crazy things in Jerusalem and the West Bank — that they took their eyes off the ball. America cannot protect Israel in the long run from the very real threats it faces unless Israel has a government that reflects the best, not the worst, of its society, and unless that government is ready to try to forge compromises with the best, not the worst, of Palestinian society.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,11,1714,0.228,0.069,0.159,0.54,0.5,0.118,0.508,0.094,0.096,0.5,0.3
251,45209,Anemona Hartocollis,The New York Times,"At Harvard, a Battle Over What Should Be Said About the Hamas Attacks","After a student group blamed Israel for the violence, Lawrence Summers, a former university president, condemned the leadership for not speaking up. Within a few days of the George Floyd killing and Russia’s war against Ukraine, Harvard and other universities issued statements, claiming solidarity with the victims. Immediately after the Hamas attacks in Israel — in which assailants killed women and children — Harvard was quiet even as criticism mounted over an open letter from a student coalition. The letter, from Harvard Palestine Solidarity Groups, said it held “the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence.” The backlash to that letter turned Harvard’s silence into a roar. On Monday, Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary and former Harvard president, condemned the university’s leadership, for not denouncing the pro-Palestinian letter. “In nearly 50 years of @Harvard affiliation, I have never been as disillusioned and alienated as I am today,” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Harvard’s silence, coupled with the student coalition letter, he said, “has allowed Harvard to appear at best neutral towards acts of terror against the Jewish state of Israel.” On Monday night, and again with more force on Tuesday, Harvard spoke. Its president, Claudine Gay, issued two statements, ultimately condemning “the terrorist atrocities perpetrated by Hamas” as “abhorrent.” A spokesman said Dr. Gay was not available for comment. The debate over Israel and the fate of Palestinians has been one of the most divisive on campus for decades, and has scorched university officials who have tried to moderate or mollify different groups. But Dr. Summers’s pointed criticism raised questions about the obligation of universities to weigh in on difficult political matters. A famous 1967 declaration by the University of Chicago called for institutions to remain neutral on political and social matters, saying a university “is the home and sponsor of critics; it is not itself the critic.” But students over the years have frequently and successfully pressed their administrations to take positions on matters like police brutality, global warming and war. Dr. Summers said in an interview that he could understand the case for university neutrality in political disputes, but that Harvard had forfeited that prerogative by speaking out on many other issues. “When you fly the Ukrainian flag over Harvard yard, when you issue clear, vivid and strong statements in response to the George Floyd killing,” he said, “you have decided not to pursue a policy of neutrality.” But the controversy at Harvard is “a moment to think about the virtues of neutrality,” said Tom Ginsburg, faculty director of the newly created Forum for Free Inquiry and Expression at the University of Chicago. Dr. Ginsburg said he looked at 17 major universities and found that all but two released a statement about Ukraine. (The University of Chicago did not.) “Not one had a statement about the Ethiopia conflict, which started a year before,” he said, referring to a civil war that left thousands dead and displaced more than two million people. Avoiding statements allows the university to channel its energy into “more important things,” Dr. Ginsburg said. “But that’s not the trend. Schools seem to be speaking out. And that’s why they find themselves in political trouble.” The Harvard student letter said, “For the last two decades, millions of Palestinians in Gaza have been forced to live in an open-air prison,” and concluded that as the war unfolded, “the apartheid regime is the only one to blame.” It was signed by groups including Amnesty International at Harvard, the Harvard Kennedy School Palestine Caucus and the Harvard Divinity School Muslim Association. Several student groups that signed the solidarity statement did not respond to messages. By Tuesday afternoon, organizers concealed the coalition’s groups, citing safety. In her response on Tuesday, Dr. Gay said that “while our students have the right to speak for themselves, no student group — not even 30 student groups — speaks for Harvard University or its leadership.” That letter followed a more tepid letter on Monday, signed by Dr. Gay and 17 other deans and administrators, saying they were “heartbroken by the death and destruction,” expressing condolences to members of the Harvard community who had lost loved ones, and calling for “an environment of dialogue and empathy.” While Harvard faced heavy criticism from politicians, academics and Jewish groups, other universities braced for protest. On Monday night, there was a vigil organized by pro-Israel students at the University of Florida. On Tuesday, at California State University, Long Beach, a student group held a “Protest for Palestine.” And Bears for Palestine, at the University of California, Berkeley, has organized a campus vigil for Friday to “mourn the murder of our martyrs in Palestine.” With a number of like-minded statements coming from pro-Palestinian student groups, a number of university presidents issued their own responses that seemed to place the blame for the conflict squarely on Hamas. On Saturday, Ron Liebowitz, president of Brandeis University, issued a statement condemning “terrorism such as we have seen today perpetrated against innocent civilians.” A statement on Tuesday from New York University condemned the “indiscriminate killing of civilian non-combatants” as “reprehensible,” and acknowledged that the violence “will likely intensify the feelings of those on our campus who hold strong views on the conflict.”",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13,873,0.416,0.159,0.34,0.5,0.5,0.348,0.199,0.311,0.087,0.5,0.5
252,45209,Sheera Frenkel,The New York Times,Hamas Seeds Violent Videos on Sites With Little Moderation,"The strategy mirrors efforts by extremist groups like the Islamic State and Al Qaeda in years past. A video of a Hamas gunman firing his assault rifle at a car full of Israeli civilians was viewed more than one million times on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, since it was uploaded Sunday. A photograph of dead Israeli civilians, strewn across the side of a road in an Israeli kibbutz near the Gaza Strip, has been shared more than 20,000 times on X. And an audio recording of a young Israeli woman’s desperate cries for help as she was being kidnapped from her home has been shared nearly 50,000 times on the platform. Since Hamas launched a deadly cross-border attack into Israel over the weekend, violent videos and graphic images have flooded social media. Many of the posts have been seeded by Hamas to terrorize civilians and take advantage of the lack of content moderation on some social media sites — particularly X and Telegram — according to a Hamas official and social media experts interviewed by The New York Times. The strategy mirrors efforts by extremist groups like the Islamic State and Al Qaeda, which took advantage of the lack of guardrails at social media companies years ago to upload graphic footage to the internet. Social media companies reacted then by removing and banning accounts tied to those groups. The issue has sprouted anew in the past week, particularly on X, where safety and content moderation teams have largely disbanded under Elon Musk’s ownership, and on Telegram, the messaging platform which does virtually no content moderation. Israeli groups who monitor social media for hate speech and disinformation said graphic imagery often starts on Telegram. It then moves to X before finding its way to other social media sites. “Twitter, or X as they are now called, has become a war zone with no ethics,” said Achiya Schatz, director of FakeReporter, an Israeli organization that monitors disinformation and hate speech. “In the information war being fought, it is now a place where you just go and do whatever you want.” In the past, his group reported fake accounts or violent content to X, which removed the post if it violated its rules, Mr. Schatz said.

253,45209,Martina Stevis-Gridneff,The New York Times,The E.U.’s top diplomat says some of Israel’s actions in Gaza are ‘contrary’ to international law.,"The European Union’s top diplomat on Tuesday offered the first public hint of criticism of Israel from a Western ally since the country suffered a devastating surprise attack launched from Gaza on Saturday, saying that some of Israel’s retaliatory actions were against international humanitarian law. The official, Josep Borrell Fontelles, said that “Israel has the right” to defend itself, but that it had to be done in accordance “with international law, humanitarian law, and some decisions are contrary to international law.” He was speaking to reporters after convening an emergency meeting of all 27 E.U. foreign ministers to discuss the bloc’s position on the conflict, a session that took place at the margins of an E.U. meeting with Gulf countries in Muscat, Oman. He also stressed the E.U.’s condemnation of Hamas, describing its attacks as “mass murder of civilians.” The comments demonstrated the fine line the European Union is attempting to navigate between supporting Israel, a key ally that the bloc has grown significantly closer to in recent years in the face of mass terrorism, and standing by the Palestinian civilian population, a long-term core policy of the bloc. Mr. Borrell also offered assurances that aid to Palestinians from the European Union — their largest benefactor — would continue to flow, saying that suspending it would play into Hamas’s hands. And he called for “no blockage of water, food or electricity to the civilian population in Gaza,” and to open humanitarian corridors to facilitate people escaping to Egypt. His comments came a day after Israel ordered a “complete siege” of the Gaza Strip, with its defense minister, Yoav Gallant, saying that “no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel” would be allowed in. Israel has responded to Saturday’s attack with a barrage of airstrikes in Gaza that it says targeted Hamas centers of operation; Gazans say that the strikes have been indiscriminate and that they have nowhere to escape to.   Mr. Borrell’s reassurances on humanitarian aid appeared meant to end any confusion after contradictory statements by E.U. officials on Monday created the impression that the bloc was moving to suspend most of its aid to the Palestinians. The E.U. has earmarked more than $1 billion for the Palestinian civilian population between 2021 and 2024. The money is directed to the United Nations and other agencies that offer services, food and medical aid to civilians, and also directly funds the Palestinian Authority. Mr. Borrell said that, after talking to all E.U. ministers, “an overwhelming majority, with maybe two or three exceptions, of the member states, stated clearly that the cooperation with the Palestinian Authority has to continue and the funding has to continue and the payments should not be interrupted.” “Not all the Palestinian people are terrorists,” he added. “So a collective punishment against all Palestinians will be unfair and unproductive, will be against our interest and against the interest of the peace.”",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,16,482,0.177,0.352,0.518,0.5,0.5,0.401,0.299,0.462,0.182,0.5,0.5
254,45209,Peter Baker,The New York Times,"In Unforgiving Terms, Biden Condemns ‘Evil’ and ‘Abhorrent’ Attack on Israel","President Biden’s remarks expressed possibly the most personal anger that he has displayed in public since taking office nearly three years ago. As he took the podium and stared into the camera on Tuesday, President Biden held nothing back. He bristled with righteous indignation as he denounced the bloody Hamas attack in unforgiving terms and vowed to stand by Israel without equivocation. Over the course of 10 minutes, Mr. Biden called the strike on Israel “pure, unadulterated evil,” “sheer evil” and “indiscriminate evil.” Again and again, the outrage spilled out: “Atrocities.” “Sickening.” “Abhorrent.” “Brutality.” “Violation of every code of human morality.” He recounted one instance of rampaging violence after another, a roster of horrors that has shocked much of the world not to mention his White House. Even for a president who often wears his emotions on his sleeve, it was a striking moment, possibly the most personal anger that he has displayed in public since taking office nearly three years ago. It was raw and it was memorable. It was also an effort to leave no daylight between him and Israel during its greatest crisis in half a century, no room for his political opponents at home or America and Israel’s enemies abroad to exploit. Unlike other presidents during past eruptions of violence in the Middle East, he made no effort to express understanding of different sides, no move to urge restraint or seek diplomatic offramps. Instead, he promised that more military hardware was on its way. “In this moment, we must be crystal clear: We stand with Israel. We stand with Israel,” Mr. Biden said in the State Dining Room, shortly after getting off a call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “And we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself, and respond to this attack.” The attack has been all the more personal for Mr. Biden and his team given that at least 14 Americans were among those killed and 20 or more others remain missing and possibly held hostage by Hamas. The White House has been reaching out to the families of those unaccounted for as American intelligence agencies try to locate them. The president’s ire reflected a long history with Israel going back to the early 1970s when he was a senator and the many years since that he has positioned himself as a supporter of the Jewish state. And it mirrored emotions roiling much of the White House in recent days amid graphic reports of massacres of women and children. John F. Kirby, a normally stoic retired rear admiral who speaks for the National Security Council, briefly choked up during a CNN interview on Monday. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken’s face appeared tight, his lips pursed, while standing next to Mr. Biden on Tuesday. Jake Sullivan, the president’s ever-disciplined national security adviser, grew impassioned during a briefing after Mr. Biden’s statement....“This was an act of sheer evil,” Mr. Biden said. “More than 1,000 civilians slaughtered — not just killed, slaughtered — in Israel, among them at least 14 American citizens killed. Parents butchered, using their bodies trying to protect their children, stomach-turning reports of babies being killed, entire families slain, young people massacred while attending a music festival to celebrate peace.” The president made no effort to urge restraint from Israel as it responds. “Like every nation in the world, Israel has the right to respond, indeed has a duty to respond to these vicious attacks,” he said. And he rejected suggestions that the attack was understandable, if not justified, given what critics consider to be Israel’s repression of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. “There’s no justification for terrorism,” he said flatly. “There’s no excuse. Hamas does not stand for the Palestinian people’s right to dignity and self-determination. Its stated purpose is the annihilation of the state of Israel and the murder of Jewish people. They use Palestinian civilians as human shields. Hamas offers nothing but terror and bloodshed, with no regard for who pays the price.”",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11,674,0.049,0.402,0.038,0.61,0.5,0.295,0.168,0.047,0.109,0.5,0.5
255,45209,Steven Erlanger,The New York Times,"As War Rages, Netanyahu Battles for Reputation and Legacy","The horrors committed by Hamas on Israeli civilians are all but certain to mark Benjamin Netanyahu’s legacy no matter the outcome of the war. If Israel considers itself in a battle for its life, its longtime prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is battling for his reputation and his legacy. After leading Israel for nearly 16 years in total and priding himself on bringing the country prosperity and security, Mr. Netanyahu, 73, now confronts the vivid failure of his own policies toward the Palestinians — presiding over what many Israelis are calling the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust. The Hamas breakout from Gaza and incursion into Israel proper, killing hundreds of civilians as well as soldiers, is all but certain to mark Mr. Netanyahu’s legacy no matter the outcome of the fierce war he now promises against Hamas. On Tuesday, under pressure to do so, Mr. Netanyahu struggled to try to negotiate a unity government that included some of his main rivals, most of them experienced military officers. But disagreements continued over their demands for a smaller security cabinet to administer the war, which would sideline some of Mr. Netanyahu’s most controversial ministers. Most assume Mr. Netanyahu will keep his post for now. But Moshe Yaalon, a former army chief of staff and minister of defense, demanded that Mr. Netanyahu pay the price of his failure and resign, he said in a Facebook post. Amit Segal, a political columnist for Yedioth Ahronoth and one of the journalists considered closest to Mr. Netanyahu, said the prime minister could not escape blame for the systemic failure, and for a policy of tolerating Hamas to try to stabilize Gaza. “I can’t tell when, but it will make it very difficult for him to survive politically,” Mr. Segal said.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9,295,0.3,0.094,0.266,0.101,0.5,0.079,0.153,0.5,0.094,0.5,0.5
256,45209,Raja Abdulrahim,The New York Times,Gaza’s health ministry says that Israel is striking medical facilities.,"Gaza’s medical system and infrastructure have come under attack by Israeli airstrikes, the health ministry in the territory said on Tuesday, as hundreds of wounded fill hospital operating rooms and intensive care units. At least five medical workers have been killed, the ministry said. “The Israeli occupation has expanded its circle of targets to the medical teams, the health facilities and ambulances,” said Ashraf al-Qidra, the spokesman for the Gaza health ministry. Israel has said its strikes are targeting all sites connected with Hamas, the armed Palestinian group that controls the Gaza Strip, including the homes of members. Israel said it believes Hamas members are hiding in homes, schools and hospitals. Because its members are Palestinians from Gaza, they live among the community. Seven hospitals have been struck with Israeli airstrikes and one of them was bombed out of operation, Mr. al-Qidra said. His account could not be immediately verified, but the United Nations has said that at least two hospitals, multiple homes and two centers run by the Palestine Red Crescent Society have been hit. The strikes came as part of Israel’s response to Saturday’s attack, when hundreds of Palestinian gunmen swept across Israel’s border with Gaza, killing hundreds of civilians and soldiers and firing thousands of rockets toward the center of the country. On Monday, Israel’s defense minister announced a “complete siege” of Gaza, saying “no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel” would be allowed in. Volker Türk, the United Nations’ high commissioner for human rights, on Tuesday warned that a full siege of Gaza would exacerbate the “already dire” humanitarian situation in the coastal territory and would hurt hospitals’ ability to treat the growing number of wounded. At least 765 Palestinians have been killed since Saturday and 4,000 injured, according to Gaza’s health ministry. Gaza, a small densely populated enclave that is home to more than two million people, has been under a severe blockade imposed by Israel, and backed by Egypt, for 16 years, limiting what can go in, including medicines and medical equipment. “The hospitals in Gaza are in a very critical situation as a result of this oppressive siege and has led to a big shortage of medicine and medical tools and fuel,” Mr. al-Qidra said, referring to the new bombardment. “Everyone needs to bear responsibility to save the medical work in Gaza.” The heavy Israeli bombardment has made movement in the streets dangerous and ambulances have had difficulty transporting the dead and wounded. Instead, people have at times relied on borrowed vehicles, tuk-tuks or motorcycles. The health ministry said that at least nine ambulances had been struck since Saturday. “The health system was already suffering before this war,” said Dr. Mohammed Abu Mughaiseeb, the deputy medical coordinator in Gaza for Doctors Without Borders, widely known by its French name, Médecins Sans Frontières. He said he has seen people coming to schools and hospitals for shelter because they feel these are the safest areas — though they may not be. A building next to Al-Shifa hospital, Gaza’s largest, was struck, he said, and shrapnel hit the hospital. “If the current situation continues, we are now in day four, there will be a critical impact not just on the medical system but on every aspect of life in Gaza,” he said.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,10,547,0.17,0.092,0.279,0.5,0.5,0.106,0.097,0.122,0.139,0.5,0.5
257,45209,Motoko Rich,The New York Times,Japan is among the nations that have been measured in support of Israel.,"While the United States and other countries have offered their full-throated support for Israel in recent days, Japan is among the nations that have been more measured in public statements. Japan was not included among a list of Group of 7 countries in Europe that joined the United States in a statement on Monday offering “steadfast and united support to the State of Israel, and our unequivocal condemnation of Hamas and its appalling acts of terrorism.” Canada was also absent from the statement. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Sunday on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, that Japan “strongly condemns the attacks which severely harmed innocent civilians” but added that “Japan is deeply concerned about a number of casualties in Gaza as well” and urged “all the parties” to “exercise maximum restraint.” After a telephone call with Ayman Safadi, Jordan’s foreign minister, Yoko Kamikawa, Japan’s newly appointed foreign minister, issued a statement on Monday condemning the attacks and kidnappings by Palestinian gunmen, but added that “Japan is deeply concerned about a number of casualties caused by the attacks by the Israeli side.” During a news conference on Tuesday in Tokyo, a reporter asked Hirokazu Matsuno, the chief cabinet secretary, why Japan had not signed the joint statement from the White House and its European allies, which condemned Hamas and described the allies as “common friends of Israel.” Mr. Matsuno offered a technical answer, saying that “the international community has traditionally expressed its position on Middle East issues within various frameworks, and I understand that the statement you pointed out was issued within one of those frameworks.” He added that Japan would “cooperate with the international community, including the G7, and strengthen its efforts to reach out to both Israel and Palestine, and will make every effort to calm the situation.” Japan’s effort to balance its response may reflect a desire not to conflate Hamas, a militant group, with Palestinian civilians.

258,45209,Leily Nikounazar,The New York Times,Iran’s Supreme Leader Issues Tehran’s Latest Denial of Involvement in Israel Attacks,"Ayatollah Ali Khamenei suggested that Tehran was not behind the assault in Israel and warned of consequences from retaliatory strikes in Gaza. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, suggested on Tuesday that Iran was not behind the incursion in Israel, while praising what he called Israel’s “irreparable” military and intelligence defeat. “We kiss the foreheads and arms of the resourceful and intelligent designers” of the attack, he said in his first televised speech since Palestinian gunmen launched a devastating cross-border assault from Gaza on Saturday. But he added: “Those who say that the recent saga is the work of non-Palestinians have miscalculated.” The comments were the Iranian government’s latest denial of involvement in the incursion. On Monday, Nasser Kanaani, a spokesman for Iran’s Foreign Ministry, said that efforts to blame Tehran for the attack were a “political attempt to justify support for Israel.” Israeli officials have said publicly that they have not determined whether Iran, which provides funding to Palestinian militant groups including Hamas, which controls Gaza, was behind the attack. And the White House said on Monday that it still had no evidence that Tehran was directly involved in planning or executing the attack. Iran, which does not recognize the state of Israel, has positioned itself as a key supporter of the Palestinian cause, and Mr. Khamenei delivered his speech wearing a Palestinian scarf. He repeatedly referred to Israel as “the Zionist regime,” a term favored by Iran’s ruling clerics, and warned that it would face consequences if it continued to conduct deadly strikes against Palestinians. “The heads and decision makers of the usurping Zionist regime and its supporters should know that the massacre and mass killing of the people of Gaza will bring a greater calamity on them,” he said.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12,292,0.364,0.467,0.235,0.5,0.5,0.266,0.412,0.376,0.379,0.5,0.5

Mr. Türk said in a statement that the ability of medical facilities to treat the growing number of people wounded in Israeli strikes would be harmed by a “full siege.”  “The imposition of sieges that endanger the lives of civilians by depriving them of goods essential for their survival is prohibited under international humanitarian law,” Mr. Türk said. He added that restrictions on people and goods must be “justified by military necessity” or may amount to collective punishment. The Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza warned on Sunday of large shortages of medicine and health equipment, as well as fuel required to keep hospital electrical generators running. Mr. Türk also said he was “deeply shocked and appalled by allegations of summary executions of civilians, and, in some instances, horrifying mass killings by members of Palestinian armed groups.” He called on Palestinian armed factions to immediately release Israeli civilians who were taken hostage. About 150 people are believed to have been abducted by Palestinian gunmen in the attacks that began on Saturday. “It is horrific and deeply distressing to see images of those captured by Palestinian armed groups being ill-treated, as well as reports of killings and the desecration of their bodies,” he said. “Civilians must never be used as bargaining chips.” Peter Stano, the spokesman for the European Commission, said that taking civilians hostage is “appalling” and “against any law and any norm of civilized behavior.” He added: “Israel has the right to defend itself and its citizens.”",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16,376,0.341,0.25,0.069,0.5,0.5,0.065,0.15,0.173,0.153,0.5,0.5

261,45208,Steven Erlanger,The New York Times,Attack Ends Israel’s Hope That Hamas Might Come to Embrace Stability,"Israel had considered Hamas a terrorist organization but one that could play a useful role for Israel in the Gaza Strip, which the group controls. Now, senior Israeli officials say, Hamas must be crushed. Since its founding, Hamas has declared that Israel has no right to exist, that there are no Israeli civilians and that every Israeli citizen is a soldier of the state, and thus a legitimate target. Still, if Western nations considered Hamas a terrorist organization, they also thought that it was preoccupied with governing Palestinians crammed into Gaza. Hamas provided social services. It was even thought of as a restraint on what were considered even more radical groups. In Israel, successive governments cut quiet deals with Hamas, hoping to keep a form of stability in the Gaza Strip, which the group controls, especially after the Israelis withdrew unilaterally from the territory in 2005. But the assault launched by Hamas this weekend, with more than 900 Israelis listed as killed so far and more than 150 believed taken as hostages and human shields into Gaza, has now stripped away any remaining illusions about the group or its intentions. The attack by Hamas into Israel proper is notable for its terror, targeting not only uniformed soldiers, but also civilians, including women and children...There is much the same disillusionment in the West, especially among Europeans who have provided significant aid to Gaza, some of which has always been siphoned off by Hamas. The horrors of the weekend now cast Hamas in a new light, one which is likely to have a major effect on events going forward. The European Union, like the United States, has labeled Hamas a terrorist organization and officially boycotts it, but many Europeans see the group as freedom fighters struggling against an Israel that is slowly making a Palestinian state impossible. For many in the West, especially the young and those on the left, “Gaza is a one-word argument for Israel’s brutality toward a blockaded enclave living in miserable conditions,” said Natan Sachs, director of the Center for Middle East Policy of the Brookings Institution. Hamas, for them, was “fundamentally a nationalist resistance movement in the context of Gaza.” That view was shattered “for some, if not all, on Saturday,” he said. In Europe, there have been uniform official condemnations of the attacks and of support for Israel. But tellingly on Monday there was confusion in Brussels, when an E.U. official, Oliver Varhelyi, announced that 691 million euros, or about $730 million, in aid to the Palestinians would be put under review, an announcement quickly softened to say that humanitarian aid would continue...When Hamas said that “every civilian is a soldier, this was not rhetoric but identifying the vulnerability of the Israeli communities inside Israel,” he said. Instead, he said, the army was focused on individual terrorism in the West Bank, and the government on its controversial efforts at judicial reform...For many Palestinians, Hamas was a military organization using the only means it had to resist a far superior Israeli military and Israeli occupation, including terrorist acts, suicide bombings and rocket attacks. For Israelis, Hamas’s brutality was clear from the suicide bombing campaign of the 1990s and early 2000s, and “Gaza is a one-word argument for the danger of unilateral withdrawal and trusting in Palestinian rule,” Mr. Sachs said..But if Mr. Amidror is correct, Israel will pursue its war against Hamas with little regard for Western opinion and criticism. “It is the last time that we can allow Hamas to be strong enough to attack Israel,” he said. If Israel succeeds in destroying Hamas, he said, “it will show that when there is a real test, Israel is ready to pay the price, ready to fight and ready to make the difference. I think that we will be more appreciated by everyone in the Mideast, not just the Saudis. If the reaction of Israel will not be strong enough, we might lose some support in the Middle East.”",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11,662,0.367,0.132,0.535,0.5,0.5,0.17,0.258,0.166,0.301,0.5,0.5
262,45208,Isabel Kershner,The New York Times,Israel and Hamas Battle Around Gaza as Netanyahu Warns of ‘Long and Difficult War’,"A senior Israeli defense official said that an early estimate showed about 700 Israelis were believed to be dead, and Gaza officials said more than 400 Palestinians have been killed. Israeli troops fought to expel Palestinian militants from Israeli territory for a second day on Sunday, battling in firefights between homes, ducking under rocket fire and striking Gazan cities from the sky in retaliation for the militants’ assault, which officials described as the worst attack on Israel in decades. By evening on Sunday, the estimated death toll hovered around 1,100 people killed in 36 hours — though the number was clouded by the continued fighting and the uncertain fate of many Israelis and Palestinians in embattled areas. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Israelis to brace themselves for the days ahead. “We are embarking on a long and difficult war that was forced on us by a murderous Hamas attack,” he said in a statement, referring to the militant group that controls the Gaza Strip. He added that Israel’s military had “begun the offensive phase, which will continue with neither limitations nor respite until the objectives are achieved.” The Biden administration has condemned Hamas, which the United States classifies as a terrorist organization, and restated its commitment to normalizing ties between Israel and Arab nations in the region — a campaign that the violence threatens to upend. Two of Israel’s neighbors, Egypt and Jordan, joined calls to de-escalate the conflict.

263,45208,Julian Barnes,The New York Times,Hamas Attack Raises Questions Over an Israeli Intelligence Failure,"American and Israeli officials said none of Israel’s intelligence services had specific warning that Hamas was preparing a sophisticated assault. The devastating surprise attack by Hamas on Saturday represented an equally stunning intelligence failure by Israel that involved undetected warnings, overwhelmed missile defenses and a slow response by apparently unprepared military forces, former and current U.S. officials said. American officials said Hamas had achieved a complete tactical surprise, reflected in a death toll of at least 700 Israelis. The Palestinian militant group sent hundreds of fighters through breached walls, breaking through with bulldozers and then killing civilians and soldiers in shooting sprees that went on for hours. None of Israel’s intelligence services had specific warning that Hamas was preparing a sophisticated attack that required coordinated land, air and sea strikes, according to an Israeli defense official and American officials. While the attack also surprised many Western intelligence agencies, they do not track Hamas’s activities as closely as Israel or Egypt do. The success astounded American officials with experience in the region. Over the years, Israel has set up a network of electronic intercepts, sensors and human informants throughout Gaza, which is about half the area of New York’s five boroughs.

264,45208,Vivian Nereim,The New York Times,"Across the Mideast, a Surge of Support for Palestinians as War Erupts in Gaza","The escalation laid bare the limitations of diplomatic deals between Israel and Arab governments as long as the underlying conflict continues. “We told you so,” a Saudi scholar said. When the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco announced that they were establishing relations with Israel in 2020, Emirati officials said the deals were symbols of peace and tolerance, while then President Donald J. Trump declared “the dawn of a new Middle East.” Those words rang hollow to many in the region, though. Even in the countries that signed the deals, branded the Abraham Accords, support for the Palestinians — and enmity toward Israel over its decades-long occupation of their land — remained strong, particularly as Israel’s government expanded settlements in the Palestinian West Bank after the agreements. On Saturday, when Palestinian gunmen from the blockaded territory of Gaza surged into Israel, carrying out the boldest attack in the country in decades, it set off an outpouring of support for the Palestinians across the region. In some quarters, there were celebrations — even as hundreds of Israelis and Palestinians were killed and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel threatened a “long and difficult war” ahead. “This is the first time that we rejoice in this way for our Palestinian brothers,” said Abdul Majeed Abdullah Hassan, 70, who joined a rally with hundreds of people in the island kingdom of Bahrain. In the context of the Israeli occupation and blockade, the Hamas operation “warmed our hearts,” he said, calling his government’s deal to recognize Israel “shameful.” Demonstrations in solidarity with the Palestinians took place across the region, including in Bahrain, Morocco, Turkey, Yemen, Tunisia and Kuwait. In Lebanon, Hashem Safieddine, head of the executive council for the Iran-backed militia Hezbollah, delivered a fiery speech lauding “the era of armed resistance.” And in Egypt’s coastal city of Alexandria, a policeman opened fire on Israeli tourists, killing two Israelis and an Egyptian. “We stand fully with the rights of the Palestinian people to free their land,” said Hassan Bennajeh, one of the organizers of protests in Morocco. “We are asking to end the normalization because it doesn’t reflect the opinion of Moroccans.” The Qatar Foreign Ministry released a statement saying that it holds Israel “solely responsible for the ongoing escalation due to its continuous violations of the rights of the Palestinian people.” The government of Iran, which for years has been engaged in a shadow war with Israel and has supported Hamas, cheered the group’s attack on Israel on Saturday. And Ahmed Abu Zeid, a spokesman for the Egyptian Foreign Ministry, said on local television last night that his country “has been warning, for months, of the danger of provocative practices” by Israel. “The ongoing occupation and dehumanization of Palestinians has been on full display for decades and it has shaped the way Arabs view the conflict,” said Mr. Al-Saif, the Kuwaiti professor. “Palestine is the priority of the Arab street.”",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14,487,0.661,0.408,0.135,0.118,0.5,0.142,0.396,0.722,0.732,0.5,0.524

But they share at least one major commonality: they are all backed by Iran. The Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister, Ron Dermer, said Israel believes there was some evidence that the Iranians might have known about the attack. “Our working assumption a couple of days ago was that they hadn’t known about it directly,” he told Bloomberg TV. “Now it is unclear, and we’ll have to wait to verify it.” Nasser Kanaani, a spokesman for Iran’s foreign ministry, on Monday denied Tehran’s involvement in the attack, according to the IRNA state news agency, calling it a “political attempt to justify support for Israel.” But Iranian backing, logistics and funding have been critical to both Hamas and Islamic Jihad for years, analysts said. Hamas has publicly acknowledged receiving support from Iran. On Sunday, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi spoke with both the Palestinian Islamic Jihad leader Ziyad al-Nakhalah and the Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh...U.S. officials have said they have yet to see clear evidence of direct Iranian coordination. In an interview with CNN, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken noted the “long relationship between Iran and Hamas.” “In this specific instance, we have not yet seen evidence that Iran directed or was behind this particular attack,” Mr. Blinken said.

266,45208,Martina Stevis-Gridneff,The New York Times,The European Union will review some of its aid to Palestinians.,"The European Union’s executive arm said on Monday that the bloc, the biggest international aid donor to the Palestinian people, would review part of its aid programs after Palestinian gunmen launched deadly attacks on Israel over the weekend, but that humanitarian aid would not be affected. “In addition to the existing safeguards, the objective of this review is to ensure that no E.U. funding indirectly enables any terrorist organization to carry out attacks against Israel,” the European Commission said in a statement late Monday. “The Commission will equally review if, in light of the changed circumstances on the ground, its support programs to the Palestinian population and to the Palestinian Authority need to be adjusted.” The statement, which said it would conduct the review “as soon as possible” and would coordinate with member states, was aimed at clarifying the E.U.’s complicated and muddled response to the Palestinian attacks. The European Union provides financial aid to the Palestinian Authority and organizations that offer vital services to civilians. Any long-term freeze on assistance could have significant consequences for civilians affected by the latest violence. Precisely which E.U.-funded programs would be put under review was not immediately clear...Austria and Germany said on Monday that they were suspending aid worth tens of millions of euros while the programs were under review. On top of the joint support, countries in the bloc individually provide financial support to Palestinians, and the decision on whether to freeze that assistance rests with those governments. The European Commission stressed that its aid to Palestinians was for civilian humanitarian needs and in no way supported Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that controls Gaza and mounted the attack on Israel on Saturday. “It’s very clear that the European Union does not fund Hamas or any other terrorist organizations’ activities,” Ana Pisonero, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, said at a news conference Monday. Some E.U. leaders stressed the need to distinguish between Hamas and Palestinian civilians when deciding on the future of aid to the population. “I think we really have to make the distinction between Hamas, the terrorist organization, and very innocent Palestinians who are just as likely to be victims right now, and again, in the case of Gaza, have been for 16 years,” Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands told reporters.Gaza has been under an Israeli blockade, backed by Egypt, for at least 16 years, since Hamas seized control of the coastal strip in 2007. The blockade restricts the import of goods, including electronics and computer equipment, that could be used to make weapons, and prevents most people from leaving the enclave.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11,435,0.474,0.502,0.345,0.5,0.5,0.367,0.486,0.5,0.29,0.5,0.5
267,45208,Michael Rothfeld,The New York Times,N.Y. Officials Visiting Israel Find Themselves Confronted With War,"Representative Daniel Goldman and Senator Cory Booker had unexpected experiences of the attack, as did police officials visiting from the New York area. The air raid sirens began screaming at 6:30 a.m. Saturday, rousing Representative Daniel Goldman and his family from sleep inside their Tel Aviv hotel room. Then came a voice over the intercom, commanding them in English and Hebrew to immediately seek shelter. Mr. Goldman had just joined his wife and three young children, who had traveled to Israel a week earlier for a relative’s bar mitzvah. He stayed behind because of the latest crises in Congress. On Saturday, they had planned to spend the day on a tourist trip to the Dead Sea. Instead, they hurried out of their room in their pajamas, bewildered and fearful, to crowd into an interior stairwell in the Hilton Tel Aviv. “We waited for about 10 minutes till we got the all-clear,” Mr. Goldman said in an interview Monday, the day after his family returned to New York. “That happened maybe three or four more times Saturday morning, where we went back to our hotel room and then sirens came and we had to go to the stairwell.” Mr. Goldman, 47, who represents Lower Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn in Congress, was among a host of officials from the New York area who happened to be in Israel when Hamas launched its surprise multipronged attack from the Gaza Strip, taking at least an estimated 150 Israeli soldiers and civilians to Gaza as hostages. The conflict has within days resulted in hundreds of deaths on both the Israeli and Palestinian sides. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who sits on the Foreign Relations Committee, had arrived with staff members in Israel on Friday, ahead of a summit in Tel Aviv on regional economic integration, where he was scheduled to speak Tuesday. In a video posted from Jerusalem Sunday on X, the platform formerly called Twitter, Mr. Booker said he had been out jogging Saturday morning when his chief of staff told him to return to his hotel. “When I got back to the hotel, I joined others in the bomb shelter or the stairwells of the hotel, frightened faces,” Mr. Booker, who was not available for an interview, said in his post. “There were children and elderly, families, many Americans. There was a sense of fear and worry, and a knowledge to many of us that there were horrific things going on around the country.” Mr. Booker, who flew home Sunday, said the attacks on Israel were “at a scale that is staggering and really has not been seen in this country for over 50 years.”",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9,444,0.139,0.248,0.393,0.5,0.5,0.426,0.507,0.044,0.426,0.5,0.5
268,45207,Edward Wong,The New York Times,U.S. Continues Push for Saudi-Israel Ties Even as War With Hamas Begins,"As Israel prepares an offensive in Gaza, President Biden and his aides are gauging whether Saudi officials remain interested in opening up diplomatic relations. President Biden’s top aides scrambled on Sunday to reaffirm their commitment to the idea of potential normalization of diplomatic ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel, even as Israel prepares for the start of a full-scale war against Palestinian militants. On several American talk shows, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken cast normalization as a choice between regional peace and the terrorism carried out by Hamas, the militant group in Gaza. “It would really change the prospects of the entire region far into the future,” Mr. Blinken said on CBS News of Israel’s broadening of relations with Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, the most powerful Sunni Muslim nation in the region. “Now, who’s opposed to that? Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran. So, I think that speaks volumes. And there are really two paths before the region.” Mr. Blinken added an important caveat, which was that the drive for a diplomatic deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia could not be a substitute for a two-state solution to address the needs of the Palestinians. In recent months, Mr. Biden and his top aides have attempted to negotiate with both Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel a complex three-way normalization deal by the end of the year. The new war will almost certainly throw off that timeline, but U.S. officials have been telling Saudi and Israeli officials in calls over the weekend that they are hopeful the discussions can continue. They are also watching Saudi reaction carefully and gauging whether Prince Mohammed might change his stance, especially if the Israeli military kills many Palestinian civilians in a Gaza offensive, which would ignite outrage across the Arab world. On Saturday, after the Hamas assault, the Saudi Foreign Ministry released a statement that did not explicitly denounce the attack and instead laid the blame on Israel, saying that the Saudi government had repeatedly warned “of the dangers of the explosion of the situation as a result of the continued occupation, the deprivation of the Palestinian people and their legitimate rights and the repetition of systemic provocations against its sanctities.” The statement took Mr. Biden and several of his top aides by surprise, people with knowledge of the events said, and it angered American lawmakers who have supported the negotiations....“The Kingdom is aware that the current extreme government in Israel cannot deliver on the issue of peace,” said Hesham Alghannam, a Saudi political scientist. “In reality, Israel was not really ready to reach an agreement with the Palestinians that would give them the minimum of their needs.” Abdulaziz Alghashian, a Saudi researcher who studies Saudi foreign policy toward Israel, said that any normalization agreements would not end the enmity of Arabs toward Israel as long as the Palestinian issue remains unresolved. “Israeli integration into the region won’t happen, ever, without a settlement,” he said. “And the way it’s going, quite frankly, it’s just going to be in a perpetual war there that’s going to spill over. So I don’t see it.”",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,12,525,0.479,0.532,0.179,0.561,0.5,0.35,0.521,0.491,0.471,0.5,0.5
269,45207,Chelsia Rose Marcius,The New York Times,Pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian demonstrators stage impassioned protests in New York.,"Pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel demonstrators faced off in contentious but nonviolent protests in Manhattan on Sunday as a full-scale conflict erupted along the Gaza Strip following the Hamas attack on Israel. About 1,000 protesters gathered early in the afternoon in two locations, in Times Square and at the United Nations headquarters. The demonstrations were among dozens of largely peaceful protests across the United States, with events in Chicago and Atlanta drawing hundreds of people. But tensions rose in New York City later on Sunday afternoon as roughly 500 pro-Palestinian demonstrators and supporters of Israel confronted one another outside the Israeli consulate in Midtown Manhattan. They yelled at and taunted one another from either side of Second Avenue near East 42nd Street where, at one point, they stormed the barricades that the police had put in place and filtered into the road. Police officers held out their arms to keep each group at bay. Several pro-Israeli protesters verbally threatened a few people on the Palestinian side, who then snatched an Israeli flag and ripped it apart. Israeli demonstrators shouted “terrorists,” and the pro-Palestinians replied “Allahu akbar.” Earlier, in Times Square, about 300 demonstrators joined a pro-Palestinian rally organized by several socialist and pro-Palestinian groups, including the Palestinian Youth Movement and Party for Socialism and Liberation. It was promoted on social media by the New York City branch of Democratic Socialists of America. One of the demonstrators was Mohammad Jarrar, a 33-year-old Queens resident, who said his family was displaced by Israel from Palestinian land in 1948 and 1967. “All the Palestinians want to do is for people to return to their homes,” he said.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10,272,0.344,0.454,0.411,0.5,0.5,0.328,0.437,0.359,0.328,0.5,0.5
270,45207,Michael Shear,The New York Times,Biden Says Military Assistance Is on Its Way to Israel,"Israel has asked for “additional assistance,” according to Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken. The United States is working to fulfill several specific requests from Israel for military assistance in the wake of the attack by Hamas on Saturday, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” program on Sunday morning. Mr. Blinken said that the Israeli government had “asked for some specific additional assistance” as the country gears up for what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned will likely be a prolonged conflict. Mr. Blinken declined to provide additional details about specific weapons systems that might be provided to Israel in the near future. White House officials said President Biden told Mr. Netanyahu in a call on Sunday that military assistance is on its way to Israel and more will follow in the days ahead. In the latest call between the two leaders, Mr. Biden “discussed the taking of hostages by Hamas terrorists, including entire families, the elderly, and young children,” according to a readout of the call by the White House. “The president emphasized that there is no justification whatsoever for terrorism, and all countries must stand united in the face of such brutal atrocities,” according to the White House. The United States already provides Israel more than $3 billion in military assistance every year, and Mr. Blinken said that much of the equipment from that funding is already “in the pipeline” to be sent to Israel. There are also six pre-positioned stockpiles of American ammunition and arms in locations throughout Israel, according to military officials, that are designated for use by Israel in case of an emergency or for a military operation in the area by the United States. The six stockpiles include a total of about $2 billion in material, and both countries would have to sign off on their use.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10,309,0.581,0.505,0.537,0.5,0.5,0.541,0.518,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5
271,45207,Euan Ward,The New York Times,Hezbollah and Israel exchange artillery and rocket fire.,"United Nations peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon said Sunday that the situation on the Lebanese-Israeli border was “volatile, but stable,” after an exchange of artillery and rocket fire by Hezbollah and Israel earlier in the day. Early Sunday, Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militant organization that fought a war with Israel in 2006, said it had attacked three Israeli posts with artillery shells and guided missiles in the Shebaa Farms area, land it considers to be occupied Lebanese territory. The Israel Defense Forces responded with artillery fire and a drone strike that it said targeted what it called “Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure,” according to a statement. Speaking at a demonstration in Hezbollah’s stronghold in Beirut’s southern suburbs, Hashem Safieddine, a senior official in the militant group, referred to Sunday’s attack as “a message.” “Our history, our guns and our rockets are with you,” he said, addressing Palestinian militants from afar. “We are not neutral in this war.” Hezbollah said Saturday that it had been in direct contact with Hamas, but it did not pledge to join the attack against Israel at that time, after a call by Hamas for its armed groups in Lebanon to join its assault. Both Hamas and Hezbollah, as well as another militant group, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, receive weaponry and intelligence from Iran, according to Israeli defense officials. Tensions along the border remained high on Sunday and some U.N. peacekeeping troops in southern Lebanon were staying in shelters for their own safety, according to Andrea Tenenti, a spokesman for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, or UNIFIL. Such precautions were previously adopted in April when rockets were launched from Lebanon after an Israeli police raid at the Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem, and Israeli forces retaliated with airstrikes. UNIFIL has moved since Hamas’s attacks on Saturday to enhance its presence along the volatile Lebanese-Israeli border. Mr. Tenenti said that any escalation in Israel’s northern border “could have disastrous consequences for people living in the area.”",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8,328,0.294,0.528,0.346,0.5,0.5,0.273,0.517,0.495,0.5,0.5,0.5
272,45207,Tiffany May,The New York Times,A Quick Look at Hamas,"The Islamist militant group that controls Gaza has taken its attacks on Israel to a new level, building on decades of hostilities. Hamas, an armed Palestinian group, launched one of the largest assaults on Israel in decades on Oct. 7, killing more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians, taking more than 220 hostages and leading Israel to declare war. The largest of the armed Islamist groups in the Gaza Strip, Hamas governs that Palestinian territory, home to two million people. What is Hamas? Hamas was founded in 1987 by Sheik Ahmed Yassin, who was active in the Muslim Brotherhood, during the first Palestinian uprising against the Israeli military control of the West Bank and Gaza. Hamas has since been responsible for suicide attacks against Israeli civilians, and the kidnapping and killing of Israeli soldiers. The United States is among the countries that have deemed it a terrorist group. But Hamas is also the governing power in the Gaza Strip, and has been since 2007. Unlike the Palestine Liberation Organization, led by Mahmoud Abbas, Hamas does not recognize Israel’s right to exist as a state and has spoken about driving all Jews from the region. It has advocated an uncompromising position on the creation of a Palestinian state based on Islamic fundamentalism stretching from the Mediterranean east to the Jordan River. An Arabic acronym for Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas was founded on three pillars: religion, charity and the fight against Israel. For years it has had a contentious relationship with its rival Palestinian party, Fatah, led by Mahmoud Abbas. A year after Israel’s 2005 withdrawal from Gaza, Hamas won Palestinian legislative elections, beating Fatah. In 2007, after factional fighting in Gaza, it ousted the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority and seized control of the Gaza Strip. In the early years, Hamas was widely embraced by Palestinians as the group most willing to resist Israel, and it was seen by some as less corrupt and better organized than the Palestinian Authority. But dissatisfaction has risen as Palestinians’ lives have worsened amid conflict and years of Israeli and Egyptian blockade, and some feel the group’s attacks have damaged Palestinians as well. Within the Gaza Strip, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the second largest militant group in the area, are frequently united against Israel. Islamic Jihad often acts independently of Hamas and is focused primarily on military confrontation. On some occasions, Hamas has exerted pressure on Islamic Jihad to stop attacks or retaliation against Israel or stayed on the sidelines as the group clashed with Israel. At others, Hamas has been drawn into battle. Hamas is allied with Middle Eastern countries like Syria and entities like the Shiite Islamist group Hezbollah in Lebanon that oppose U.S. and Israeli policies. One of its most vocal supporters is Iran, which has its own interests in battling Israel. For decades, Iran has given Hamas weapons, technology and training to build its own arsenal of advanced rockets that can reach deep into Israeli territory.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5,494,0.432,0.078,0.336,0.5,0.5,0.116,0.115,0.172,0.283,0.5,0.5
273,45207,Patrick Kingsley,The New York Times,‘There were terrorists inside’: An Israeli recounts how militants invaded his village.,"A resident of a town taken by Hamas militants describes hearing attackers outside his window, running and shooting, as they tried to find people to take hostage. When the rockets from Gaza started flying over his village in southern Israel at dawn on Saturday, Amir Tibon was not overly alarmed. Mr. Tibon and his neighbors in Kibbutz Nahal Oz, a village that stands a few hundred yards from the Gaza Strip, have become accustomed to frequent rocket fire from militants in Gaza. Bomb shelters are installed in every home, and residents are used to rushing into them every few weeks. But soon after Mr. Tibon, 35, took shelter on Saturday with his wife and two young daughters, he knew something was very different about this attack. The sound of gunfire. Then came a morbid realization. “There were terrorists inside the kibbutz, inside our neighborhood and — at some point — outside our window,” Mr. Tibon recalled in a phone interview on Sunday morning. “We could hear them talk. We could hear them run. We could hear them shooting their guns at our house, at our windows.” On the village WhatsApp group, neighbors were posting frantic messages. “People were saying, ‘They are in my house, they are trying to break into the safe room!’” recalled Mr. Tibon, a prominent journalist for Haaretz, a left-leaning broadsheet. Messages from fellow reporters revealed even more terrifying news. They said that Hamas, a militant group that controls Gaza, had infiltrated scores of Israeli border towns and that it would take time for the Israeli Army to reach the village. Then came an unlikely glimmer of hope. Mr. Tibon’s parents, who live in Tel Aviv, messaged to say they were on the way to rescue the family. Dressed in civilian clothes and armed only with his pistol, Mr. Tibon’s father, Noam, had persuaded a group of Israeli commandos to let him join them as they tried to regain control of Kibbutz Nahal Oz.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12,327,0.096,0.323,0.405,0.5,0.5,0.13,0.381,0.5,0.388,0.5,0.5
274,45206,Eric Schmitt,The New York Times,Military experts say the Hamas attacks were unusually sophisticated.,"Independent military experts said on Saturday that the strikes by Hamas militants from Gaza against Israel were highly unusual for the group — coordinated attacks using rockets and missiles, infiltrations of Israeli towns, even a failed assault by water. And while analysts said it seemed unlikely the militants could defeat the Israeli military in a prolonged fight, one major aim seemed to be to draw other countries in the region into a wider war. “The attack itself was very complex,” said Mick Mulroy, a former top Pentagon Middle East official and retired C.I.A. paramilitary officer. Mr. Mulroy said the invasion was preceded by a barrage of thousands of rockets and missiles that likely stunned much of the Israeli armed forces and the police forces. Militants then used technical means to disrupt Israel communications, he said, before launching a multipronged air, sea and land attack with assaulters roaring in on tractors to clear Israeli defensive barriers. Pickup trucks loaded with soldiers, small boats and manned paragliders were also part of the assault. “These multiple means of attack probably gave the IDF a significant tactical dilemma,” Mr. Mulroy said, referring to the Israeli military. “From a purely military perspective, the Hamas operation was groundbreaking,” said Bilal Saab, director of the Middle East Institute’s defense and security program in Washington. “The missiles were used for diversion. The goal was infiltration, which succeeded. This is what Hezbollah threatened Israel with in the 2000s.” Mr. Ali said it was odd that Israeli intelligence appeared to have missed signs the attack was coming. “Significant questions arise over how Israeli intelligence was unable to detect strategic or tactical indicators of the operation, given their longstanding excellence in domestic and foreign intelligence,” Mr. Ali said. Analysts also said they saw the probable influence, if not direct support, from Iran in the strikes, especially given Tehran’s longstanding relationship with Hamas and its supply of money, weapons, and training. “The operation’s complexity indicates a nation-state like Iran was behind this supporting the attackers with weapons and munitions, intelligence, and possibly operational planning,” said Mr. Mulroy.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,9,345,0.251,0.245,0.193,0.5,0.5,0.489,0.153,0.5,0.115,0.5,0.5
275,45206,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,Israel’s Worst Day at War,"When I need the most accurate analysis about Israel, the first call I always make is to my longtime friend and reporting partner there, Nahum Barnea, a veteran Yediot newspaper columnist. When I called him on Saturday afternoon for his read on the Hamas attack on Israel, I was stunned by his first response: “This is the worst day that I can remember in military terms in the history of Israel, including the blunder of the Yom Kippur War, which was terrible.” Nahum is a careful reporter who has covered every major event in Israel for the past half century, and when he explained his rationale, I realized it was an understatement. This is not your usual Hamas-Israel dust-up. The Gaza-Israel border is only 37 miles long, but the shock waves this war will unleash will not only thrust Israel and the Palestinians of Gaza into turmoil, but will also slam into Ukraine and Saudi Arabia and most likely Iran. Why? Any prolonged Israel-Hamas war could divert more U.S. military equipment needed by Kyiv to Tel Aviv, and it will make the proposed Saudi-Israeli normalization deal impossible — for now. And if it turns out that Iran encouraged the Hamas attack to scuttle that Israeli-Saudi deal, it could raise tensions between Israel and Iran and Tehran’s Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah, and also between Saudi Arabia and Iran. This is an incredibly dangerous moment on multiple fronts. But going back to Nahum’s point: Why is this war such a disaster for Israel, worse than the Yom Kippur surprise attack from Egypt and Syria, which happened 50 years and one day ago? For starters, said Nahum, there is the sheer humiliation of it for the Israeli military: “In 1973 we were attacked by the biggest Arab army, Egypt.” This time Israel was invaded in 22 locations outside the Gaza Strip, including communities as far as 15 miles inside Israel, by a military force belonging to “the equivalent of Luxembourg.” And yet this tiny force not only invaded Israel, overwhelming Israeli border troops; it took Israeli hostages back to Gaza across that same border — a border where Israel had spent roughly $1 billion erecting a barrier that was supposed to be virtually impenetrable. That is a shocking blow to Israel’s deterrent capabilities. Why did Hamas launch this war now, without any immediate provocation? One has to wonder if it was not on behalf of the Palestinian people but rather at the behest of Iran, an important supplier of money and arms to Hamas, to help prevent the budding normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia, Iran’s rival, and Israel. Such a deal, as it was being drawn up, would also benefit the more moderate West Bank Palestinian Authority — by delivering to it a huge infusion of cash from Saudi Arabia, as well as curbs on Israeli settlements in the West Bank and other advances to preserve a two-state solution. As a result, West Bank leaders might have earned a desperately needed boost of legitimacy from the Palestinian masses, threatening the legitimacy of Hamas. That U.S.-Saudi-Israel deal also would have been a diplomatic earthquake that would have most likely required Netanyahu to jettison the most extreme members of his cabinet in return for forging an alliance between the Jewish state and the Sunni-led states of the Persian Gulf against Iran. Altogether, it would have been one of the biggest shifts in the tectonic plates of the region in 75 years. In the wake of this Hamas attack, that deal is now in the deep freeze, as the Saudis have had to link themselves more closely than ever with Palestinian interests, not just their own. Personally, I do not believe that Hamas can ever be a partner for a secure peace with Israel. Hamas has had way too many chances for way too many years to prove that the responsibilities of governing in Gaza would moderate its goal of destroying the Jewish state. It turns out to be nothing more than a Palestinian Islamist mafia, interested only in preserving its grip on Gaza and being ready to serve as a cat’s paw for Iran instead of making its main goal a new future for Palestinians there and in the West Bank. Its history of rule in Gaza is shameful. But the Palestinian Authority can be a partner. So if there is going to be an Israeli invasion of Gaza to try to destroy Hamas, it has to be paired with a political initiative that empowers and helps to strengthen that Palestinian Authority so we can forge, as Victor put it, “a settlement that provides all sides with something they can live with. Otherwise, sooner or later, we will be right back in the same situation — only worse. That was the true lesson of the Yom Kippur War.”",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5,803,0.038,0.424,0.482,0.31,0.5,0.131,0.398,0.435,0.107,0.5,0.5

Israel retaliated with huge strikes on Gazan cities. Israel battled on Saturday to repel one of the broadest invasions of its territory in 50 years after Palestinian militants from Gaza launched an early-morning assault on southern Israel, infiltrating 22 Israeli towns and army bases, kidnapping Israeli civilians and soldiers and firing thousands of rockets toward cities as far away as Jerusalem. By early evening, the Israeli military said fighting continued in at least five places in southern Israel; multiple Israelis had been abducted and taken to Gaza, including an elderly grandmother; and at least 250 Israelis had been reported dead by officials and more than 1,400 wounded. Israel retaliated with huge strikes on Gazan cities, and the Gaza Health Ministry said at least 234 Palestinians had been killed in either gun battles or airstrikes. In an assault without recent precedent in its complexity and scale, the militants crossed into Israel by land, sea and air, according to the Israeli military, leading to some of the first pitched battles between Israeli and Arab forces on Israeli soil in decades. “We are at war and we will win it,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said in a televised statement, announcing a call-up of hundreds of thousands of Israeli military reservists. Muhammad Deif, the leader of Hamas’s military wing, said in a recorded message that the group had decided to launch an “operation” so that “the enemy will understand that the time of their rampaging without accountability has ended.” He cited Israel’s occupation of the West Bank, which it captured during the Arab-Israeli war of 1967, recent Israeli police raids on the Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem and the detention of thousands of Palestinian militants in Israeli jails.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,10,303,0.09,0.093,0.319,0.616,0.5,0.376,0.132,0.223,0.087,0.5,0.5

The Hamas militant group’s armed wing said in a statement on Telegram, a messaging app, that it had fired additional rockets in response to Israel’s decision to bomb a high-rise building in Gaza earlier on Saturday. The Israeli military said it struck Hamas military infrastructure in two multistory buildings in the enclave. Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system fired interceptors in an attempt to destroy the rockets, which sent missile sirens blaring in cities across Israel’s heartland. But some managed to slip through and land in at least four cities, according to the Israeli police and medics. Magen David Adom, Israel’s emergency service, said medics were treating at least three seriously wounded Israelis in the cities of Rishon LeZion and Yavne.

Violent images and graphic videos flooded social media on Saturday, claiming to show the dead and wounded bodies of Israeli and Palestinian civilians. On X, formerly known as Twitter, a violent video claiming to show the kidnapping of Israeli soldiers had been viewed hundreds of thousands of times on Saturday morning. The New York Times found hundreds of X accounts sharing images of dead bodies, claiming to be Israeli civilians killed in the past 24 hours of fighting. Some of the images viewed by The Times appeared to be manipulated and edited.

279,45206,Ronen Bergman,The New York Times,Israel’s defense failures may change strategy toward Hamas and Gaza.,"The broad attack by Palestinian militants, which Hamas viewed as mostly successful, revealed some significant failures. Hamas’s attack on Saturday took Israeli intelligence officials by surprise, particularly the methods the militants used to enter and leave Israel, according to a senior defense official familiar with the information collected about the group. The broad attack, mostly successful from Hamas’s point of view, revealed some significant failures by the Israeli defense establishment. It also may change Israel’s overall strategic approach to Hamas and the Gaza Strip, said the official, who asked not to be identified when discussing security matters. And that could have a far-reaching effect on the entire Middle East. Until now, Israel has contained Hamas and Gaza with a strategy that hinged on an intelligence network that would warn against Hamas’s moves, and on the power of the Israeli Army to repel a ground invasion by Hamas. In the Hamas attack on Saturday, these two safeguards failed. Israel is traditionally perceived as the strongest intelligence power in the region, with extensive coverage of the Gaza Strip. And in recent months, Israeli intelligence did repeatedly warn that a military conflict could flare up because Iran and affiliated militias have perceived Israel as weakened by the nation’s profound divisions over the judicial overhaul being pursued by the ultraright governing coalition of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to four senior defense officials. Still, while Israeli intelligence collected some indications that Hamas was planning a major operation, they were far from forming a clear picture, one of the officials added. Israel, the official said, did not pick up on the elaborate preparations that were most likely needed for the 250 Hamas militants tasked to lead the assault, and target military bases, cities and kibbutzim. American officials, too, said that both Israel and the United States had known a Hamas attack at some point was possible, or even likely. But they said there was no specific tactical warning of the strikes on Saturday, no sign that would have allowed Israel to take specific measures. Many questioned why Israel and the United States were blindsided. Mick Mulroy, a former C.I.A. officer and senior Pentagon official, said the complexity of the attack by Hamas indicated that it would have required much preparation.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10,375,0.081,0.146,0.201,0.193,0.5,0.185,0.329,0.089,0.456,0.5,0.5
280,45206,Gaya Gupta,The New York Times,Biden and other U.S. leaders condemn the Hamas attacks on Israel.,"U.S. leaders on both sides of the aisle were quick to stand with Israel and condemn Hamas, the Islamic armed group that controls Gaza, after Palestinian militants from the group launched a broad attack against southern Israel on Saturday morning. President Biden in a statement called it an “appalling assault on Israel by Hamas terrorists.” He added that the United States stands “ready to offer all appropriate means of support” to Israel. Despite his sometimes strained relationship with Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr. Biden also emphasized the longstanding partnership between their two countries. “My administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering,” he said. The Israeli prime minister spoke with Mr. Biden by phone earlier on Saturday and told him that “a forceful and continued battle will be required, in which Israel will triumph,” Mr. Netanyahu’s office said in a statement. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on social media that the White House would “stand in solidarity with the government and people of Israel and extend our condolences for the Israeli lives lost in these attacks.” “We unequivocally condemn the appalling attacks by Hamas terrorists against Israel,” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11,198,0.35,0.584,0.826,0.745,0.5,0.466,0.571,0.402,0.402,0.5,0.5
281,45206,Farnaz Fassihi,The New York Times,"Iran, a longtime backer of Hamas, cheers the attacks.","The government of Iran, which for years has been engaged in a shadow war with Israel and has supported Hamas, cheered the group’s attack on Israel on Saturday. “The forceful response of young Palestinians today to the child-murdering Zionist regime showed that it is more vulnerable than ever and the young Palestinians have the upper hand,” said Ali Bahadori Jahromi, the spokesman of Iran’s government. Iran has for decades backed Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that controls Gaza and whose own interests in battling Israel align with Iran’s. Experts say that over the years, Iran has provided Hamas with financial and political support, weapons and technology and training to build its own arsenal of advanced rockets that can reach deep into Israeli territory. There was no immediate sign that Iran had coordinated with Hamas on its most recent attacks. But one of Iran’s most senior military commanders said Iran would fully support Gaza’s operation, which the group has called Al-Aqsa Storm, after the mosque in Jerusalem’s Old City. “We are confident that all the resistance groups in the region will support this,” said Gen. Yayha Rahim Safavi, the top military adviser to Iran’s supreme leader and a former commander in chief of the Revolutionary Guards Corps. Iranian media and social media channels affiliated with the Guards provided minute-by-minute updates of the conflict, boasting that Iran-backed militants had caught Israel off guard in one of the most serious security breaches in recent years. The social media channels, mostly on Telegram, posted photos and videos of the rockets, quadcopter drones and military equipment at Hamas’s disposal, and congratulatory messages with every news flash that an Israeli had been injured or killed. “Today’s operation opened a new chapter in the field of resistance and armed operations against the occupiers in the occupied territories,” Nasser Kanani, the spokesman of Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said. In the last few years, Israel has orchestrated a string of covert attacks on Iran, including the sabotaging of Iran’s nuclear facilities. While Iran’s leaders have made no secret of their desire to punish Israel for the wave of attacks, they have struggled to find an effective way to retaliate without risking an all-out war or derailing any chance for a revised nuclear accord with the United States and other world powers. On Saturday, celebratory fireworks went off in Tehran outside of the building housing the Palestinian diplomatic mission to Iran, videos shared on state media showed. Crowds waving Palestinian flags and firecrackers chanted, “Death to Israel,” as car horns and whistles blared.

282,45206,Raja Abdulrahim,The New York Times,Gaza Has Suffered Under 16-Year Blockade,"Held in place by Israel and Egypt, the blockade restricts imports to the region and prevents most people from leaving. For some Gazans, Saturday morning’s surprise Palestinian attack into southern Israel seemed a justified response to a 16-year Israeli blockade. Others worried that the coordinated attack would only add to Gaza’s misery as the tiny enclave braced for a large-scale response from Israel. The Palestinian territory of Gaza has been under a suffocating Israeli blockade, backed by Egypt, since Hamas seized control of the coastal strip in 2007. The blockade restricts the import of goods, including electronic and computer equipment, that could be used to make weapons and prevents most people from leaving the territory. More than two million Palestinians live in Gaza. The tiny, crowded coastal enclave has a nearly 50 percent unemployment rate, and Gaza’s living conditions, health system and infrastructure have all deteriorated under the blockade. Israel says the blockade is necessary to stop the flow of arms into the territory, but Palestinians and aid groups say it is collective punishment and exacerbates dire economic and social conditions. Diplomats say that Hamas had repeatedly indicated in recent months that it did not want a major military escalation in Gaza, in part to avoid worsening the humanitarian situation so soon after the devastation of a war in 2021. The Gazan authorities are still repairing buildings damaged or destroyed by Israeli airstrikes during previous rounds of fighting, including five days of war in May between Israel’s military and Islamic Jihad, the second-largest armed group in Gaza. And some Gazans are worried about losing access to Israeli work permits, a major lifeline for the enclave’s limping economy. Gaza’s hospitals regularly suffer from equipment and medicine shortages because of the blockade, and Palestinians in Gaza must apply for permits to leave the enclave to seek treatment either in the West Bank or inside Israel. In the past, Gaza’s sole power plant has at times been forced to shut down for lack of fuel when Israel has closed the border crossings for goods. Civilians, especially children, in Gaza have paid a high price. In 2021, at least 67 children were killed in Gaza during 11 days of fighting between Israel and Hamas. In May, at least 12 civilians were killed by Israeli strikes during the fighting in May this year. Israel’s military says that it conducts “precision strikes” on Gaza aimed at taking out armed groups’ commanders or operation sites, and that it does not target civilians. But Palestinians say that strikes on heavily populated areas amount to a collective punishment and that civilians have been targeted.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,6,435,0.081,0.118,0.078,0.5,0.5,0.08,0.128,0.2,0.079,0.5,0.5
283,45206,Euan Ward,The New York Times,Hezbollah says it is in touch with Hamas and monitoring the attack.,"Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militant organization that fought a war with Israel in 2006, said Saturday that it was in contact with Hamas but stopped short of pledging to join the Gazan group’s attack against Israel.Responding to a call from Hamas, the Islamic armed group that controls Gaza, for armed groups in Lebanon to join its assaults on Israel, Hezbollah said in a statement that it was “closely following the important developments in the Palestinian situation with great interest.” It added that it “was in direct contact with the leadership of the Palestinian resistance at home and abroad and is conducting a continuous assessment of the events and the conduct of operations.” Since fighting a full-scale war in 2006, both Israel and Hezbollah have avoided another major confrontation along the frontier between Israel and Lebanon, keeping cross-border fire and infiltration to a minimum. Lebanon’s other political leaders were characteristically divided in their reaction to the attacks. Some celebrated them outright while others firmly warned against Lebanon being dragged into the conflict. Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, has yet to comment publicly. Political allies of Hezbollah and Amal, the country’s two biggest Shiite political parties, towed a more cautious line than those groups. The Free Patriotic Movement of former President Michel Aoun, a Maronite Christian bloc and an ally of Hezbollah, said in a statement that the attacks were a “reaction of a people who have no choice but to resist in the face of all the occupation.” But it added that Lebanon must attempt to avoid the repercussions of such instability in the region. Among Hezbollah’s political rivals, Samir Geagea, the leader of the Christian Lebanese Forces party, warned against implicating Lebanon “in bearing what they cannot endure,” referring to the country’s already compounding crises. The attacks on Israel were celebrated in parts of Lebanon’s capital, Beirut, with children handing out candy to passing motorists, and residents waving Palestinian flags setting off fireworks.

284,45206,Emma Bubola,The New York Times,The militants’ statement cited the Aqsa Mosque. Here’s why it matters.,"The military wing of Hamas, Al Qassam Brigades, described Saturday’s surprise assault on Israel as an operation “in defense of the Aqsa Mosque,” invoking a dispute around a site that is sacred to both Muslims and Jews and that is among the most deeply contested in the holy land. The mosque sits in a 35-acre site that is considered the holiest in Judaism and the third holiest in Islam. Muslims call the site — which also includes the Dome of the Rock shrine — Haram al-Sharif, or the Noble Sanctuary. According to Islamic scripture, the Prophet Muhammad traveled from Mecca to the site in one night, where he prayed, and then ascended to heaven. Jews call the site the Temple Mount, because it was the location of two ancient temples, which were destroyed. Israel captured East Jerusalem and the Old City, which contains the site, during the Arab-Israeli War of 1967, then annexed it, but most countries consider it to be occupied territory. The mosque is administered by the Waqf, a trust controlled by Jordan, under a status quo agreement. Israeli security forces maintain a presence on the site, and Jews and Christians can visit, but for years they were prevented from praying on the site to prevent clashes. More recently, the Israeli police have quietly allowed Jews to pray there. Israeli religious nationalists have increasingly made a point of going to the site, and Saturday’s statement from the Hamas military wing cited Jewish prayer at the compound, saying that what it called “aggression” there had “reached a peak in the past days.” The site has long been a flashpoint. The deadly, yearslong second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, developed in the wake of a visit there in 2000 by Ariel Sharon, then Israel’s right-wing opposition leader. Recent years have brought clashes over Israeli police raids at the site. Israeli raids on the mosque compound in May 2021 contributed to sparking an 11-day war between Israel and Hamas.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11,327,0.537,0.353,0.361,0.5,0.5,0.245,0.169,0.086,0.5,0.5,0.5

For Israelis, Saturday’s surprise assault from Gaza was a recurring nightmare, coming 50 years and a day after invading forces from Egypt and Syria caught Israel off-guard, setting off a 19-day war that has long traumatized the nation. Israeli television channels and newspapers have been filled in recent days with commemorations of that war, and many Israelis on Saturday saw parallels between the attack unfolding around them and the events decades earlier. That war also began on the Sabbath, with sirens wailing across the country on Oct. 6, 1973, on Yom Kippur, the holiest day on the Jewish calendar. On Saturday, many Israelis had been planning to celebrate the holiday of Simchat Torah. Instead, the armed wing of Hamas, the Islamic group that controls Gaza, fired thousands of rockets toward Israel. Simultaneously, reports flooded in of a major breach of Israel’s fortifications along its border with Gaza, the Palestinian coastal enclave that Israel and neighboring Egypt have kept under blockade for 16 years, citing security reasons. Unverified images soon began to emerge of heavily armed Palestinian militants entering Israeli border communities in pickup trucks, on motorcycles and in at least one case crossing the fenced border by paraglider. Gruesome unverified videos began to circulate, purporting to show the bloodied corpses of Israeli soldiers and of hostages taken into Gaza. Terrified Israeli residents in border villages phoned in to local television stations from safe rooms. Speaking in whispers, they pleaded for help and said they could hear the militants outside, or even inside, their homes. As confusion and fear spread, many were asking how the Israeli government and its vaunted military and intelligence services could have been caught by surprise — again.

286,45206,Aaron Boxerman,The New York Times,Violence between Palestinians and Israelis has been seething for months.,"It has been years since Israel has experienced the kind of violence taking place on Saturday. But tensions between Israelis and Palestinians have been surging for months, as have warnings of the risk of all-out war. Most of the recent focus has been on the occupied West Bank, where recurring Israeli military operations have sparked frequent gun battles with Palestinian militants. Israel and Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip have also fought smaller tit-for-tat engagements. April: An Israeli police raid at the Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem prompted Palestinian rocket fire from Gaza. Unusually, militants also fired rockets from Lebanon — across Israel’s volatile northern border — raising fears of a wider war. The Israeli military responded with airstrikes in southern Lebanon and against Gaza targets belonging to Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that controls the coastal enclave. But neither side escalated the violence, and the situation slowly calmed. May: Israel and the Iran-backed Islamic Jihad militant group fought a short battle — the second in less than a year. After the death in an Israeli prison of Khader Adnan, a hunger-striking Palestinian militant, Islamic Jihad launched a barrage of rockets. A week later, Israeli airstrikes killed three top Islamic Jihad leaders, setting off another round of fighting. The violence lasted only a few days, with Israel killing Islamic Jihad commanders in targeted airstrikes and Palestinian militants firing rocket barrages at Israeli cities. But Hamas, whose capabilities and weapons outstrip those of Islamic Jihad, mostly stayed out of the fighting.

289,45203,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,How Four Leaders Are Turning the World Upside Down,"Ever since learning that in 1947, Walter Lippmann popularized the term “Cold War” to define the emerging conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States, I thought it would be cool to be able to name a historical epoch. Now that the post-Cold War has expired, the post-post-Cold War that we’ve entered is just begging to be named. So here goes: It’s the age of “That Was Not the Plan.” I know, I know, that doesn’t trip off the tongue — and I don’t expect it to stick — but boy is it accurate. I stumbled across it on a recent trip to Ukraine. I was speaking with a Ukrainian mother who explained that since the war started, her social life had been reduced to occasional dinners with friends, kids’ birthday parties “and funerals.” After typing her quote into my column, I added my own comment: “That was not the plan.” Before last year, young Ukrainians had been enjoying easier access to the E.U., embarking on tech start-ups, thinking about where to go to college and wondering whether to vacation in Italy or Spain. And then, like a meteor, comes this Russian invasion that turns their lives upside down overnight. She is not alone. A lot of people’s plans — and a lot of countries’ plans — have gone completely haywire lately. We’ve entered a post-post-Cold War era that promises little of the prosperity, predictability and new possibilities of the post-Cold War epoch of the past 30 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall. There are many reasons for this, but none are more important than the work of four key leaders who have one thing in common: They each believe that their leadership is indispensable and are ready to go to extreme lengths to hold on to power as long as they can. I am talking about Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu. The four of them — each in his own way — have created massive disruptions inside and outside their countries based on pure self-interest, rather than the interests of their people, and made it far harder for their nations to function normally in the present and to plan wisely for the future. Take Putin. He started off as something of a reformer who stabilized post-Yeltsin Russia and oversaw an economic boom, thanks to rising oil prices. But then oil revenues started to sag, and as the Russia scholar Leon Aron describes it in his forthcoming book, “Riding the Tiger: Vladimir Putin’s Russia and the Uses of War,” Putin made a big turn at the start of his third presidency in 2012, after the largest anti-Putin rallies of his rule in 100 Russian cities broke out and his economy stalled. Putin’s solution: “Shift the foundation of his regime’s legitimacy from economic progress to militarized patriotism,” Aron told me, and blame everything bad on the West and NATO expansion. In the process, Putin made Russia into a besieged fortress, which, in his mind and propaganda, only Putin is capable of defending — and therefore requires that he stay in power for life. He went from Russia’s distributor of income to a distributor of dignity, earned in all the wrong ways and places. His invading Ukraine to restore a mythical Russian Motherland was inevitable. Events in China have also unfolded quite unexpectedly of late. After steadily opening up and loosening internal controls since 1978, making it more predictable, stable and prosperous than at any other time in its modern history, China experienced an almost 180-degree U-turn under President Xi: He dispensed with term limits — respected by his predecessors to prevent the emergence of another Mao — and made himself president indefinitely. Xi apparently believed that the Chinese Communist Party was losing its grip — leading to widespread corruption — so he reasserted its power at every level of society and business, while also eliminating any rivals. It has made China more closed than any time since the days of Mao — complete with the sudden disappearances of the ministers of defense and foreign affairs — and sparking talk that we may have already seen “peak China” in terms of the country’s economic potential, which would be an earthquake for the global economy. It was certainly not in my plan that after nearly a lifetime following Israel’s struggles with foreign enemies, I would end up writing about how the biggest threat to the Jewish democracy today is an enemy within — a judicial coup led by Netanyahu that is splintering Israel’s society and military. The former director general of the Israeli Defense Ministry, Dan Harel, told a Tel Aviv democracy rally last week that “I have never seen our national security in a worse state” and that there has already been “damage to the reserve units of essential IDF formations, which has reduced readiness and operational capability.” This is no small problem for the United States. For the past 50 years, Israel has been both a crucial ally and, in effect, a forward base in the region through which America projected power without the use of U.S. troops. Israel destroyed both Iraq’s and Syria’s budding attempts to become nuclear powers. Israel is the main counterweight today for containing the expansion of Iranian power across the whole region. But if we have three more years of this extremist Netanyahu government, with its aspiration to annex the West Bank and govern Palestinians there with an apartheidlike system, the Jewish state could become a major source of instability in the region, not stability, and a much more uncertain ally — more like Turkey and less like the Israel of old. And why? In a recent Times profile of Bibi, Ruth Margalit quoted Ze’ev Elkin, a former Likud minister in Netanyahu’s cabinet, as describing Netanyahu thus: “He began with a worldview that said, ‘I’m the best leader for Israel at this time.’ Slowly it morphed into a worldview that said, ‘The worst thing that can happen to Israel is if I stop leading it, and therefore my survival justifies anything.’” Needless to say, watching Donald Trump’s effort to overturn our 2020 election by inspiring a mob to ransack the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and then seeing this same man become the leading Republican candidate for president in 2024, makes our next election among our most important ever — so that it won’t be our last ever. That was not the plan. To the extent that there is a common denominator that binds these four leaders, it’s that they have all breached the rules of their game at home — and, in Putin’s case, started a war abroad — for an all-too-familiar reason: to stay in power. And their local systems — the Russian elite, the Chinese Communist Party, the Israeli electorate and the Republican Party — have not been able to effectively or entirely constrain them. But there are also important differences among the four. Netanyahu and Trump are facing pushback in their democracies, where voters may yet oust or stop both of them — and neither has started a war. Xi is an autocrat, but he does have an agenda to improve the lives of his people and a plan to dominate the major industries of the 21st century, from biotech to artificial intelligence. But his increasingly iron-fisted rule may be exactly what prevents China from getting there, chiefly because it’s sparking a brain drain. Putin is nothing but a mafia boss masquerading as a president. He will be remembered for transforming Russia from a scientific powerhouse — which put the first satellite into orbit in 1957 — into a country that can’t manufacture a car, a watch or a toaster that anyone outside of Russia would buy. Putin had to dial 1-800-NorthKorea to scrounge for aid for his ravaged army in Ukraine Trump, ultimately, is the most dangerous of the four — for one simple reason: When the world becomes this chaotic, and such key countries go off the plan, the rest of the world depends on the United States to take the lead in containing the trouble and opposing the troublemakers. But Trump prefers to ignore the trouble and has praised the troublemakers, including Putin. It’s what makes the prospect of another Trump presidency so frightening, so reckless and so incomprehensible. Because America is still the tent pole that holds up the world. We don’t always do it with wisdom, but if we were to stop doing it at all — watch out. Given what’s already going on in these other three important countries, if we go wobbly, it will birth a world where nobody will be able to make any plans. There’s an easy name for that: the Age of Disorder.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,9,1458,0.097,0.62,0.226,0.147,0.341,0.5,0.154,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.429
290,45134,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,Biden Is Weighing a Big Middle East Deal,"For the hundreds of thousands of Israeli democracy defenders who tried to block Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s judicial coup on Monday, the stripping of the Israeli Supreme Court’s key powers to curb the executive branch surely feels like a stinging defeat. I get it, but don’t totally despair. Help may be on the way from talks between the United States and Saudi Arabia. Yes, you read that right. When I interviewed President Biden in the Oval Office last week, my column focused on his urging Netanyahu not to ram through the judicial overhaul without even a semblance of national consensus. But that’s not all we talked about. The president is wrestling with whether to pursue the possibility of a U.S.-Saudi mutual security pact that would involve Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel, provided that Israel make concessions to the Palestinians that would preserve the possibility of a two-state solution. After discussions in the past few days among Biden; his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan; Secretary of State Antony Blinken; and Brett McGurk, the top White House official handling Middle East policy, Biden has dispatched Sullivan and McGurk to Saudi Arabia, where they arrived Thursday morning, to explore the possibility of some kind of U.S.-Saudi-Israeli-Palestinian understanding. The president still has not made up his mind whether to proceed, but he gave a green light for his team to probe with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia to see if some kind of deal is possible and at what price. Closing such a multinational deal would be time-consuming, difficult and complex, even if Biden decides to take it to the next level right away. But the exploratory talks are moving ahead now — faster than I thought — and they’re important for two reasons. First, a U.S.-Saudi security pact that produces normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and the Jewish state — while curtailing Saudi-China relations — would be a game changer for the Middle East, bigger than the Camp David peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. Because peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia, the custodian of Islam’s two holiest cities, Mecca and Medina, would open the way for peace between Israel and the whole Muslim world, including giant countries like Indonesia and maybe even Pakistan. It would be a significant Biden foreign policy legacy. Second, if the United States forges a security alliance with Saudi Arabia — on the conditions that it normalize relations with Israel and that Israel make meaningful concessions to the Palestinians — Netanyahu’s ruling coalition of Jewish supremacists and religious extremists would have to answer this question: You can annex the West Bank, or you can have peace with Saudi Arabia and the whole Muslim world, but you can’t have both, so which will it be? Now wouldn’t that make an interesting discussion around Netanyahu’s cabinet table? I’d love to see Israel’s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, go on Israeli television and explain to the Israeli people why it is in Israel’s interest to annex the West Bank and its 2.9 million Palestinian inhabitants — forever — rather than normalize ties with Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Muslim world. A Saudi-Israeli peace could dramatically reduce the Muslim-Jewish antipathy born over a century ago with the start of the Jewish-Palestinian conflict. But before such a choice — annexation or normalization — can be brought before this extremist Israeli government, a lot of things have to be agreed to by a lot of people. That said, Jake Sullivan is not in Riyadh today for tourism. The Saudis are seeking three main things from Washington: a NATO-level mutual security treaty that would enjoin the United States to come to Saudi Arabia’s defense if it is attacked (most likely by Iran); a civilian nuclear program, monitored by the United States; and the ability to purchase more advanced U.S. weapons, like the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense antiballistic missile defense system, which are particularly helpful to the Saudis against Iran’s growing mid- and long-range missile arsenal. Among the things the U.S. wants from the Saudis are an end to the fighting in Yemen, where the conflict has blessedly been diminishing over the past year, an unprecedentedly large Saudi aid package to Palestinian institutions in the West Bank and significant limits on the growing relationship between Saudi Arabia and China. For instance, the U.S. was not amused by reports last year that Saudi Arabia was considering accepting Chinese renminbi to price some oil sales to China instead of the U.S. dollar. Over time, given the economic clout of China and Saudi Arabia, that could have a very negative impact on the U.S. dollar as the world’s most important currency. That would have to be canceled. The U.S. also wants the Saudis to curtail their dealings with Chinese tech giants like Huawei, whose latest telecommunications equipment is banned in the U.S. This would be the first time the U.S. signed a mutual security pact with a nondemocratic government since President Dwight Eisenhower did so with predemocratic South Korea in 1953, and it would require Senate approval. Just as important, though, is what the Saudis would demand of Israel to preserve the prospect of a two-state solution — the way the United Arab Emirates demanded that Netanyahu forgo any annexation of the West Bank as a price for their Abraham Accords. The Saudi leadership is not particularly interested in the Palestinians or knowledgeable about the intricacies of the peace process. But if the Biden team made a deal without a significant Palestinian component, it would simultaneously strike a death blow to the Israeli democracy movement — by giving Netanyahu a huge geopolitical prize for free after he just did something so antidemocratic — and to the two-state solution, the cornerstone of U.S. Middle East diplomacy. I don’t believe Biden will do that. It would spark a rebellion in the progressive base of his party and make ratification of the deal well nigh impossible. “It will be hard enough for President Biden to sell any deal like this to the U.S. Congress,” Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, which funds the State Department, said to me. “But I can assure you that there will be a strong core of Democratic opposition to any proposal that does not include meaningful, clearly defined and enforceable provisions to preserve the option of a two-state solution and to meet President Biden’s own demand that Palestinians and Israelis enjoy equal measures of freedom and dignity. These elements are essential to any sustainable peace in the Middle East.” I believe that, at a minimum, the Saudis and Americans could (and should) demand four things from Netanyahu for such a huge prize as normalization and trade with the most important Arab Muslim state: An official promise not to annex the West Bank — ever. No new West Bank settlements or expansion outward of existing settlements. No legalization of wildcat Jewish settlement outposts. And transferring some Palestinian populated territory from Area C in the West Bank (now under full Israeli control) to Areas A and B (under Palestinian Authority control) — as provided for in the Oslo accords. In return, the Palestinian Authority would have to endorse Saudi Arabia’s peace deal with Israel. Truth be told, the Palestinian Authority is in no position to engage in peace talks with Israel today. It’s a mess. The Palestinians need to remake their government, but in the meantime, the far-right ministers in Israel’s cabinet are trying to absorb as much of the West Bank as fast as they can. The urgent need is to stop that immediately — but not with another dose of finger wagging from the State Department about how “deeply troubled” the U.S. is about Israeli settlements. Rather, the best move is a big strategic initiative that has something significant for everyone, except the zealots on all sides. I repeat: Any deal will take months of difficult negotiations among the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Israel and the Palestinian Authority — and success would be a long shot, at best. But if Biden decides to try for it and the U.S. could put on the table a deal that is hugely in America’s strategic interest, hugely in Israel’s strategic interest, hugely in Saudi Arabia’s strategic interest (admitting it into a very exclusive club of countries with a U.S. security umbrella) and revive Palestinian hopes for a two-state solution, that would be a very, very big deal. And if it also forced Netanyahu to abandon the extremists in his cabinet and make common cause with the Israeli center left and center right, well, wouldn’t that just be the cherry on top?",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,8,1452,0.662,0.314,0.769,0.238,0.5,0.5,0.563,0.548,0.5,0.5,0.5
291,44869,Thomas Friedman,The New York Times,The Israel We Knew Is Gone,"Imagine you woke up after the 2024 U.S. presidential election and found that Donald Trump had been re-elected and chose Rudy Giuliani for attorney general, Michael Flynn for defense secretary, Steve Bannon for commerce secretary, evangelical leader James Dobson for education secretary, Proud Boys former leader Enrique Tarrio for homeland security head and Marjorie Taylor Greene for the White House spokeswoman. “Impossible,” you would say. Well, think again. As I’ve noted before, Israeli political trends are often a harbinger of wider trends in Western democracies — Off Broadway to our Broadway. I hoped that the national unity government that came to power in Israel in June 2021 might also be a harbinger of more bipartisanship here. Alas, that government has now collapsed and is being replaced by the most far-far-right coalition in Israel’s history. Lord save us if this is a harbinger of what’s coming our way. The coalition that Likud leader Bibi Netanyahu is riding back into power is the Israeli equivalent of the nightmare U.S. cabinet I imagined above. Only it is real — a rowdy alliance of ultra-Orthodox leaders and ultranationalist politicians, including some outright racist, anti-Arab Jewish extremists once deemed completely outside the norms and boundaries of Israeli politics. As it is virtually impossible for Netanyahu to build a majority coalition without the support of these extremists, some of them are almost certain to be cabinet ministers in the next Israeli government. As that previously unthinkable reality takes hold, a fundamental question will roil synagogues in America and across the globe: “Do I support this Israel or not support it?” It will haunt pro-Israel students on college campuses. It will challenge Arab allies of Israel in the Abraham Accords, who just wanted to trade with Israel and never signed up for defending a government there that is anti-Israeli Arab. It will stress those U.S. diplomats who have reflexively defended Israel as a Jewish democracy that shares America’s values, and it will send friends of Israel in Congress fleeing from any reporter asking if America should continue sending billions of dollars in aid to such a religious-extremist-inspired government. You have not seen this play before, because no Israeli leader has “gone there” before. Netanyahu has been propelled into power by bedfellows who: see Israeli Arab citizens as a fifth column who can’t be trusted; have vowed to take political control over judicial appointments; believe that Jewish settlements must be expanded so there is not an inch left anywhere in the West Bank for a Palestinian state; want to enact judicial changes that could freeze Netanyahu’s ongoing corruption trial; and express contempt for Israel’s long and strong embrace of L.G.B.T.Q. rights. We are talking about people like Itamar Ben-Gvir, who was convicted by an Israeli court in 2007 of incitement to racism and supporting a Jewish terrorist organization. Netanyahu personally forged an alliance between Ben-Gvir’s Jewish Power party and Bezalel Smotrich, the leader of the Religious Zionism party, which turned them (shockingly for many Israelis) into the third-largest party in the country — giving Netanyahu the allies Likud needed to win a parliamentary majority in this week’s election. Smotrich is known for, among other things, suggesting that Israeli Jewish mothers should be separated from Arab mothers in the maternity wards of Israeli hospitals. He has long advocated outright Israeli annexation of the West Bank and argued that there is “no such thing as Jewish terrorism” when it comes to settlers retaliating on their own against Palestinian violence. Netanyahu has increasingly sought over the years to leverage the energy of this illiberal Israeli constituency to win office, not unlike how Trump uses white nationalism, but Netanyahu never actually brought this radical element — like Ben-Gvir, who claims to have moderated because he has told his supporters to chant, “Death to terrorists,” instead of, “Death to Arabs” — into his ruling faction or cabinet. As more of Netanyahu’s allies in Likud split with him over his alleged criminal behavior and lying, however, Bibi had to reach further and further out of the mainstream of Israeli politics to get enough votes to rule and pass a law to abort his own trial and possible jail time. Netanyahu had fertile political soil to work with, the Yediot Ahronot Israeli newspaper columnist Nahum Barnea explained to me. There has been a dramatic upsurge in violence — stabbings, shootings, gang warfare and organized crime — by Israeli Arabs against other Israeli Arabs, and Israeli Arab gangs and organized crime against Israeli Jews, particularly in mixed communities. The result is that, “like in America, ‘policing’ has become a huge issue in Israel in recent years,” said Barnea — and even though this upsurge started when Netanyahu was previously prime minister, he and his anti-Arab allies blamed it all on the Arabs and the national unity Israeli government. One election billboard summed up Netanyahu’s campaign. It was, as Haaretz reporter Amos Harel reported, a “gloomy-looking one with the caption: ‘That’s it. We’ve had enough.’ It depicts outgoing Prime Minister Yair Lapid and his coalition partner, Mansour Abbas of the United Arab List.” Abbas is the rather amazing Israeli Arab religious party leader who recognizes the State of Israel and the searing importance of the Holocaust, and who was part of the now-fallen unity government. As Harel put it: “The ‘had enough’ message seems to have sunk in among supporters of Likud, Religious Zionism and the ultra-Orthodox parties. It’s likely that the message also helped Netanyahu win Tuesday’s election.” Among the critical factors, Harel wrote, was “hatred of Arabs and the desire to keep them out of positions of power.” But Netanyahu was also aided by the fact that while the right and the far right were highly energized by both growing fears of and distrust of Arabs — whether Israeli Arab citizens or Palestinians in the West Bank — their centrist and center-left opponents had no coherent or inspiring countermessage. As Barnea put it to me: “Israel is not divided down the middle,” with 50 percent being pro-Netanyahu and the other 50 percent with a unified message and strategy opposing him. “No, Israel is divided between the 50 percent who are pro-Netanyahu and the 50 percent who are pro-blocking Netanyahu. But that is all they can agree on,” Barnea said. And it showed in this election. And it wasn’t enough. Why is all of this so dangerous? Moshe Halbertal, the Hebrew University Jewish philosopher, captured it well: For decades members of the Israeli right, a vast majority of whom were “security hawks,” have believed that the Palestinians have never and will never accept a Jewish state next to them and therefore Israel needed to take whatever military means were necessary to protect itself from them. But Israeli hawkishness toward the Palestinians, explained Halbertal, “is now morphing into something new — a kind of general ultranationalism” that not only rejects any notion of a Palestinian state but also views every Israeli Arab — who make up about 21 percent of Israel’s population, nearly 20 percent of its doctors, about 25 percent of its nurses and almost half its pharmacists — as a potential terrorist. “What we are seeing is a shift in the hawkish right from a political identity built on focusing on the ‘enemy outside’ — the Palestinians — to the ‘enemy inside’ — Israeli Arabs,” Halbertal said. Netanyahu’s coalition has also attacked the vital independent institutions that underpin Israel’s democracy and are responsible for, among other things, protecting minority rights. That is, the lower court system, the media and, most of all, the Supreme Court, which Netanyahu and his allies want brought under the political control of the right, “precisely so they will not protect minority rights” with the vigor and scope that they have, Halbertal said. At the same time, not only is this election a struggle about the future of Israel, he said, but also “about the future of Judaism in Israel. The Torah stands for the equality of all people and the notion that we are all created in God’s image. Israelis of all people need to respect minority rights because we, as Jews, know what it is to be a minority” — with and without rights. “This is a deep Jewish ethos,” Halbertal added, “and it is now being challenged from within Israel itself. But, when you have these visceral security threats in the street every day, it becomes much easier for these ugly ideologies to anchor themselves.” This is going to have a profound effect on U.S.-Israel relations. But don’t take my word for it. On Oct. 1, Axios published a story quoting what sources said Senator Bob Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat who leads the Foreign Relations Committee, told Netanyahu during a trip to Israel in September. In the words of one source, the senator warned that if Netanyahu formed a government after the Nov. 1 elections that included right-wing extremists, it could “seriously erode bipartisan support in Washington.” That is now about to happen. I have reported from Israel for this newspaper for nearly 40 years, often traveling around with my dear friend Nahum Barnea, one of the most respected, sober, balanced, careful journalists in the country. To hear him say to me minutes ago on the phone that “we have a different kind of Israel now” tells me we are truly entering a dark tunnel.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6,1558,0.161,0.416,0.375,0.215,0.116,0.5,0.376,0.125,0.5,0.5,0.49
